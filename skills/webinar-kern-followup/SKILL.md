# Kern Post-Webinar Follow-Up Frameworks

Frank Kern's OTHER CROWN JEWEL - the post-webinar system most presenters completely ignore. This is where you convert the 80%+ who attended but didn't buy immediately.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating post-webinar follow-up sequences for attendees who didn't buy
- Designing objection-handling videos that continue teaching

## The Complete System Architecture

```
WEBINAR ENDS
    ↓
ATTENDEE LIST EXPORT (GoToWebinar)
    ↓
SEGMENTATION (Attended + Didn't Buy)
    ↓
OBJECTION SEQUENCE (2 videos, 1-2 days)
│   ├─ Video #1: Belief-level objection
│   └─ Video #2: Case study + process
    ↓
COUNTDOWN SEQUENCE (5 emails, 4 days)
│   ├─ Day 1: Bonus #1 + Deadline announced
│   ├─ Day 2: Bonus #2 announced
│   ├─ Day 3: Recap both bonuses

## Core Principles

### 1. Work Within the Confines of Reality
"Most people won't make a snap decision to give you a lot of money, especially after 3 hours of webinar + Q&A. They need more information, objections handled, and more incentive to buy."

### 2. Continue the Goodwill
"They enjoyed the webinar because I made it informative. Why not continue that goodwill and continue to demonstrate you can help them by actually helping them?"

### 3. Long-Term Relationship Thinking
"Even if they don't buy from this video, I have another one. Even if they don't buy from this whole campaign, if I maintain goodwill, they will eventually buy something."

### 4. Demonization of the Objection
"The thing you think you need, that you don't like doing - you really don't have to do it, and actually it sucks and hurts your results. One of the great unifiers is having a common thing to stand AGAINST as well as stand FOR."

### 5. Compound Psychological Pressure
"As a deadline gets closer, desire to purchase increases. I learned we could exponentially compound that pressure by simultaneously piling on more value as the deadline grew closer." (Scarcity + Greed)

### 6. Legitimate Deadlines Only
"It needs to be a real deadline. Price hike or complete unavailability. Use Scarcity Samurai or Infusionsoft to make links actually invalid after deadline. Never fake it."

## Objection Video Deep Dive

### The 35-Second Hook Pattern
**First 35 seconds must accomplish:**
1. Reintroduce yourself
2. Thank them for attending (recency)
3. Frame around question/request they've made
4. Set positive expectation ("I'm going to do one even better")

"Your first couple of seconds are critical. Within the first 35, I've already sold them on watching the next 35 seconds."

### Mini-Webinar Structure for Videos
**Apply the same framework at 15-30 minute scale:**

**INTRO** (2-3 min)
- Reintroduce yourself
- Thank them for attending
- Frame the question

**DIFFERENCE** (3-5 min)
- Position against what they hate
- "I'm not sitting across from you promising fast and easy results"
- Earn trust through takeaway

**BOND** (5-10 min)
- Tell relevant story
- Include earnings disclaimer strategically
- Case study setup

**PAYOFF** (10-15 min)
- Teach the content
- Address the objection through education
- Deliver genuine value

**PITCH** (5-10 min)
- Transition naturally
- Recap full offer using 12-part structure
- Make enrollment simple

### Teaching-to-Pitch Ratio
- 60% teaching/bonding
- 40% selling
- "If you precede your sale with really solid content and bonding, and you're doing something very relevant to their interests, they don't mind a lot of time spent on the close."

### Objection as Question Framing
"Never say 'You have this objection and I want to overcome it.' Instead: 'I'm getting a lot of questions about X...' This removes shame and positions you as helpful."

### Positioning Against What They Hate
"I cannot stress enough how important it is to not only move towards what they like, but also really directly and blatantly position yourself as being against that which they don't like."

"Your marketplace is not stupid even though they're treated as such by your competition."

## Countdown Sequence Deep Dive

### The Compound Pressure System
**Two psychological levers pulling simultaneously:**
1. **SCARCITY PRESSURE** - Deadline approaching (fear of loss)
2. **GREED PRESSURE** - Bonuses accumulating (desire for gain)

"We could exponentially compound the level of pressure by simultaneously piling on more value as the deadline grew closer."

### Legitimate Deadline Options
1. **Price hike** (Kern's favorite) - "Goes up by $1,080 on DATE"
2. **Complete unavailability** - "Won't teach the class live again"
3. **Bonus removal** - Bonuses expire with deadline
4. **Feature reduction** - Get less-cool version after deadline

### Bonus Stacking Psychology
**Progressive introduction:**
- Email #1: Announce bonus #1 with full benefits + reason why
- Email #2: Announce bonus #2 with full benefits + reason why
- Email #3-5: Recap all bonuses (cut and paste descriptions)

**Reason Why for Each Bonus:**
"In the consulting class, you'll generate lots of leads. But problem: not all become clients, and you can't take them all. This bonus shows you how to monetize those leads another way. So by giving it to you, we're both winning."

### Reason Why for Deadline
"I've decided to keep the class small and not do a launch. It's better this way because I'll be able to answer your questions better and give each student more time and attention. Because of this, I've set a DEADLINE."

The constraint serves THEM, not you.

### Subject Line Escalation
1. **Email #1:** "NAME: BREAKING NEWS" (curiosity)
2. **Email #2:** "Like a $10K check payable to ~FirstName~ ~LastName~" (value)
3. **Email #3:** "NAME FYI" (casual)
4. **Email #4:** "DEADLINE IS MIDNIGHT" (urgency)
5. **Email #5:** "PRICE HIKE (12 hours to go)" (maximum urgency)

### Final 24 Hours Intensity
"Now is when we really want to start hammering this deadline, because we've got about 24 hours to go. We've already reminded them of the bonuses. So now it's time to really play up the scarcity, which again needs to be legitimate and real."

The urgency is EARNED because you spent days adding value and explaining why the deadline exists.

## Technical Implementation

### Attendee Segmentation
**Only send post-webinar sequence to people who:**
1. Attended the webinar live (not just registered)
2. Did not purchase during or immediately after

**Different sequences for:**
- Attended + Bought = Fulfillment sequence
- Attended + Didn't Buy = Objection + Countdown sequence
- Registered + Didn't Attend = Replay or re-registration sequence

### Data Export and Upload
**GoToWebinar Export:**
1. My Webinars > Webinar History
2. Choose specific webinar
3. Click + button next to "Attended Live"
4. Generate attendee report (Excel/CSV)
5. Delete all rows above blue header
6. Delete all columns except First Name, Last Name, Email
7. Save cleaned file

**Upload Options:**
- **Manual (Infusionsoft):** Upload CSV, tag as attendees, place in sequence
- **Automated (Infusionsoft):** Use PlusThis plugin (plusthis.com)
- **Automated (Aweber/GetResponse):** Use Zapier (zapier.com)

### API Integration (1-2 Minutes)
1. Landing page builder: My Account > Integrations
2. Select your email service
3. Get API key from email service (Settings > Application)
4. Copy API key
5. Paste into integration field
6. Add account name if required
7. Click connect

### Buyer Exemption Critical
**Set purchase as "end goal" in CRM:**
- When someone buys, automatically exit sales sequences
- Enter fulfillment sequence instead
- Prevents annoying customers with "buy now" after purchase
- Test by making dummy purchase

### Timing Flexibility
"Don't be a stickler about timing. Send objection video #1 same day or as soon as possible. Send subsequent emails about a day apart. Consistency and completion matter more than precision."

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Sending Replays Instead
"If you do replays, it trains people not to show up. They just wait for the replay, which they fast-forward through and never really get many sales from."

**Fix:** No replays. Improve show-up rate through better registration timing and indoctrination sequence.

### Mistake #2: Just Re-Pitching
"Everyone else does this: 'You didn't buy, watch replay of same webinar you already saw.' That's not objection handling."

**Fix:** Create NEW teaching content that addresses WHY they didn't buy.

### Mistake #3: Fake Deadlines
"The deadline must be real and enforced technically. Use Scarcity Samurai or Infusionsoft to make links invalid."

**Fix:** Only use legitimate deadlines you actually enforce. Your credibility depends on it.

### Mistake #4: Too Much Pitch, Too Little Teaching
"The amount of money they pay you is in direct proportion to the confidence they have in you."

**Fix:** 60% teaching, 40% selling. Earn the right to pitch.

### Mistake #5: Over-Complicated Tech
"Keep technical stuff as simple as possible. Don't integrate services just because you can. Manual process that takes 30 seconds per registrant beats integration that takes 2 hours to set up and breaks when you need it."

**Fix:** Start simple. Add automation only when manual becomes painful at scale.

### Mistake #6: Ignoring Timing Between Registration and Webinar
"Very few people think about this, but the amount of time that passes between registration and the webinar date itself is VERY significant for show-up rates."

**Fix:** Test different windows. Most markets see peak show-up in 5-7 day window.

## Validation Questions

**Before deploying sequence:**
- Have I identified the top 2 objections from webinar brainstorming or actual attendee questions?
- Do my objection videos teach genuinely helpful content (60%+)?
- Is my deadline legitimate and technically enforced?
- Do my bonuses have clear "reason why" that shows strategic fit?
- Have I set up buyer exemption so customers don't get sales emails?
- Does my sequence maintain goodwill or feel like begging?
- Can I defend my deadline if someone asks why it exists?

**After first deployment:**
- What's my conversion rate from objection videos vs countdown sequence?
- Which emails get highest open rates? (Optimize subject lines)
- Which emails drive purchases? (Double down on what works)
- Are buyers actually exiting the sequence or getting annoyed?
- What new objections am I hearing? (Create video for next time)

## Psychology of the System

### The Confines of Reality
"Work within the confines of reality: most people will not make a snap decision to give you a lot of money, especially after 90 minutes of webinar plus 30-90 minutes of Q&A (up to 3 hours total). They need more information, objections handled, and more incentive to buy."

### Goodwill Continuation
"They just got off this webinar with me that they enjoyed because I make my webinars very informative. Why not continue that goodwill and continue to demonstrate you can help them by actually helping them?"

### Long-Term vs Short-Term
"I know that even if they don't buy from this video, I have another one. Even if they don't buy from this whole campaign, if I maintain goodwill, they will eventually buy something."

### Demonization Strategy
"Not only move towards what they like, but also really directly and blatantly position yourself as being against that which they don't like. One of the great unifiers of all mankind is to have a common thing to stand against as well as a common thing to stand for."

### Compound Pressure
"As a deadline gets closer and the threat of not being able to get something or the threat of loss of a bargain looms near, the desire to purchase becomes greater. We could exponentially compound that pressure by simultaneously piling on more value."

## Kern's Results

"Just doing this has dramatically increased my closing from webinars. My value per attendee has gone up tremendously."

The post-webinar sequence is NOT optional. It's where most of your revenue comes from.
