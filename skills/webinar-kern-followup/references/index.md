# Kern Post-Webinar Follow-Up Framework Index

Complete reference for all 57 frameworks in Frank Kern's post-webinar system.

---

## Tier 1 - Crown Jewels (4 frameworks)

### 7.0 Complete Post-Webinar Funnel Architecture
**Pattern Type:** Strategic
**Use When:** Designing the complete post-webinar follow-up system for non-buyers

The complete sequence: (1) Webinar happens, (2) Same day or ASAP: Send objection handling video #1, (3) Next day: Send objection handling video #2, (4) Day after final objection video: Begin 4-day countdown sequence with 5 emails adding bonuses and escalating urgency. All automated through email autoresponder.

**Kern's Quote:** "Instead of sending a replay out and sending that replay to them 950 times, the best way to do it is to deploy this sequence. Just doing this has dramatically increased my closing from webinars. My value per attendee has gone up tremendously."

---

### 7.1 Long-Term Relationship Thinking
**Pattern Type:** Strategic
**Use When:** Making decisions about how helpful to be versus how much to pitch in post-webinar content

Always prioritize maintaining goodwill over making an immediate sale. Even if they don't buy from this objection video, you have the countdown sequence. Even if they don't buy from the entire campaign, if you maintain goodwill, they will eventually buy something.

**Kern's Quote:** "I know that even if they don't buy as a result of this one, I have another one, I still have my countdown sequence later. And even if they don't buy from this whole campaign, if I maintain that goodwill, they will eventually buy something."

---

### 7.0 The Psychology of Post-Webinar Buying
**Pattern Type:** Psychological
**Use When:** Understanding why the post-webinar sequence is necessary

Work within the confines of reality: most people on a webinar will not make a snap decision to give you a lot of money, especially after 90 minutes of webinar plus 30-90 minutes of Q&A (up to 3 hours total). They need more information, they'll have objections, and they need more incentive to buy.

**Kern's Quote:** "From that attendee's perspective, it's very hard for them to be thinking at this point, especially after attending like a 90 minute webinar followed by a 30 minutes to 90 minute Q&A. Up to three hours of interactive content. I'm not expecting most people on a webinar to make a snap decision to give me a lot of money."

---

### 7.2 Countdown Sequence Architecture
**Pattern Type:** Strategic
**Use When:** Creating the scarcity-based post-webinar sequence after objection handling videos

The countdown sequence runs for 4 days after the objection handling videos. It combines two psychological levers: (1) Scarcity pressure from an approaching deadline, and (2) Greed pressure from accumulating bonuses. Also called the "Death Grip Sequence" but renamed to be less aggressive-sounding.

**Kern's Quote:** "As a deadline gets closer and the threat of not being able to get something or the threat of loss of a bargain looms near, the desire to purchase and the pressure that we place on ourselves to make that purchase becomes greater. And I learned that we could exponentially compound the level of pressure by simultaneously piling on more value as the deadline grew closer."

---

## Tier 2 - Core Systems (20 frameworks)

### 7.1 Post-Webinar Objection Sequence Structure
**Use When:** Following up with attendees who didn't buy during the webinar

Two-part post-webinar sequence: (1) OBJECTION SEQUENCE - 2 emails with objection-handling videos, (2) COUNTDOWN SEQUENCE - deadline-driven emails. Email 1 sent right after webinar addresses biggest objection through teaching video. Email 2 sent next morning addresses second objection with case study, introduces deadline.

---

### 7.1 Case Study Video Framework
**Use When:** Creating the second objection handling video when you have a relevant client success story

Frame the video as a case study that walks through exactly how someone got results. Structure: (1) Thank them for attending and remind of recent engagement, (2) Frame as answering specific request, (3) Promise to exceed expectations, (4) Tell story with disclaimers, (5) Deliver teaching/walkthrough, (6) Make pitch with better close structure than video #1.

**Kern's Quote:** "Anytime you have something like that happening after a webinar with any degree of regularity, that is like a great big neon sign that says, if you give us this information in a way that exceeds our expectations and makes us even happier than we anticipated, we will probably give you some money."

---

### 7.1 Video Opening Recency Pattern
**Use When:** Opening every objection handling video and post-webinar communication

First 35 seconds must accomplish: (1) Reintroduce yourself, (2) Thank them for attending the webinar (recency reminder), (3) Frame around a question/request they've made, (4) Set positive expectation for what's coming.

**Kern's Quote:** "Within that first 35, I've already sold them to a degree on watching, say, the next 35 seconds. So within that first 35 seconds there, which is good. So remember one thing I could ever teach you in video is that your first couple of seconds are critical."

---

### 7.1 Earnings Disclaimer Positioning
**Use When:** Sharing client results or case studies in objection videos

After setting up the case study promise but before diving into the story, insert the earnings disclaimer. Position it as: "I'm telling you about this success to illustrate the methods and give you context of how they worked in the real world. It's by no means an implication of what you might do."

**Kern's Quote:** "The reason I'm telling you about the success of this client is to illustrate the methods I'm teaching you now in this video and sort of give you context of how these methods worked in the real world. It is by no means at all to be considered any implication or indication of a future earnings claim to what you might do."

---

### 7.1 Positioning Against What They Hate
**Use When:** Throughout all objection handling content, especially after the disclaimer

After the disclaimer, explicitly position yourself against the stuff they're sick of: "I'm not sitting across from you, I don't really know what you're going to do"—this is takeaway and differentiation. Distance yourself from everyone saying "this is fast and easy and you'll make $100,000."

**Kern's Quote:** "I cannot stress enough how important it is to not only move towards what they like, but also really directly and blatantly position yourself as being against that which they don't like."

---

### 7.1 Mini-Webinar Structure for Objection Videos
**Use When:** Structuring any objection handling video when you want a proven framework

Structure the objection video exactly like a miniature webinar: Intro (reintroduce, thank, frame the question), Difference (position against what they hate), Bond (tell a relevant story), Payoff (teach the content), Pitch (make the offer). This is a 15-30 minute version of your full webinar structure.

**Kern's Quote:** "You can literally structure them exactly like your webinar like a miniature version of the webinar, a 30, a 20 minute version, a 15 minute version of a webinar. It doesn't matter."

---

### 7.1 Teaching-to-Pitch Ratio for Video #2
**Use When:** Allocating time in the second objection handling video

Spend approximately 60% of the video on content/teaching (bonding + payoff phases), then transition to a more aggressive close for the remaining 40%. For a 20-minute video, this means about 12 minutes of teaching, 8 minutes of selling.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you precede your sale, your offer, with really solid content and really solid bonding, and you're doing something very relevant to their interests, they don't mind a lot of time spent on the close."

---

### 7.1 Two-Video Objection Sequence Standard
**Use When:** Planning the objection handling phase of post-webinar sequence

Use two objection handling videos as standard. Video #1 addresses the primary belief-level objection. Video #2 tells a case study and addresses implementation/process questions. You can make three videos if you want, but two is the efficient standard before moving to countdown sequence.

**Kern's Quote:** "These two videos in the series, these are the objection handling videos. I usually use two. You can make three if you want, but I wanna go ahead and get to that countdown sequence."

---

### 7.1 Objection Handling Video Structure
**Use When:** Creating post-webinar objection handling videos to convert non-buyers

The objection handling video follows a precise structure: (1) Reintroduce yourself and thank them for attending, (2) Frame the objection as a question others are asking, (3) Teach genuinely helpful content that addresses the objection, (4) Transition to the pitch only after substantial value delivery, (5) Keep pitch concise but clear.

**Kern's Quote:** "The purpose of it, like I've said a million times, is genuinely to be helpful to the viewer. I think you can't go wrong there. Second function, of course, is to overcome the objection and make the sale."

---

### 7.1 Demonization of the Objection
**Use When:** When the objection they have is associated with approaches or tactics they already dislike

Take the thing they believe they must have or must do, and show how it's directly associated with everything they hate. This isn't demonizing THEM for having the objection—it's demonizing the thing itself as bad, ineffective, or counterproductive.

**Kern's Quote:** "The thing that you think you got to do, that you don't like doing, you really don't have to do it, and actually it sucks and it actually hurts your sales or your results. If you have the ability to make that argument, by all means, make it. It's called the demonization of the objection."

---

### 7.1 Objection as Question Framing
**Use When:** Introducing the topic of every objection handling video

Never say "You have this objection and I want to overcome it." Instead frame it as "I'm getting a lot of questions about X" or "A lot of people are asking about Y." This removes shame or defensiveness and positions you as helpful rather than combative.

**Kern's Quote:** "You want to frame this objection handling video as a question, as the answer to a question instead of, hey, you know, you have an objection and I want to overcome it."

---

### 7.1 Video Timing and Pitch Ratio
**Use When:** Determining how much teaching versus selling to include in objection videos

Spend the majority of the video (approximately 60-80%) on genuine teaching that helps them with the objection. The pitch should come only after substantial value has been delivered. In a 33-minute video, 26 minutes of teaching and 7 minutes of pitch is appropriate.

**Kern's Quote:** "Even if they don't buy as a result of this one, I have another one, I still have my countdown sequence later. And even if they don't buy from this whole campaign, if I maintain that goodwill, they will eventually buy something."

---

### 7.1 Offer Recap Requirements
**Use When:** Structuring the pitch portion of objection handling videos

In the objection video pitch, you should recap the full offer using your 12-part offer structure, even though they already saw it on the webinar. Consider writing the benefits below the video so they don't have to wait 20+ minutes to see them.

**Kern's Quote:** "I did not follow the 12-part offer structure that I showed you here in this class, and I think that following that structure would have made this video even more powerful. But nonetheless, it still worked."

---

### 7.1 Video Transition to Pitch
**Use When:** Moving from teaching content to making the offer in objection videos

Transition naturally by connecting what you just taught to the opportunity: "If this approach sounds appealing to you, and you're thinking this is something I could do, then you should really enroll in this class."

**Kern's Quote:** "If this approach sounds appealing to you, and you're thinking, you know what, I would much rather embrace the organic gardening methodology that you're getting such good results with than the typical whatever methodology that other guys are doing, then you might want to take this class."

---

### 7.2 Legitimate Deadline Options
**Use When:** Determining what happens at the countdown deadline

The deadline must be real and serious. Acceptable options: (1) Price hike (preferred), (2) Complete close of registration, (3) Bonus removal, (4) Feature reduction. Frank's favorites are price hike or complete unavailability.

**Kern's Quote:** "It needs to be some sort of an incentive, a deadline-based incentive for them to order. My favorite are either the price hike or the complete absence of availability. It needs to be a real deadline."

---

### 7.2 Five-Email Countdown Structure
**Use When:** Planning the email sequence for countdown phase

Email #1 (4 days before): Announce bonus #1 + announce deadline. Email #2 (3 days before): Announce bonus #2 + remind of deadline. Email #3 (2 days before): Recap both bonuses + restate deadline. Email #4 (24 hours before): All bonuses + deadline is tomorrow. Email #5 (12 hours before): Final notice + all bonuses.

**Kern's Quote:** "This basic formula is what I use. I set the deadline for this whole thing as a four day experience from start to finish and I send out a total of five emails. Your final email, I like to program it to go 12 hours before the deadline is set."

---

### 7.2 Bonus Stacking Psychology
**Use When:** Adding bonuses throughout the countdown sequence

Introduce bonuses progressively rather than all at once. Email #1 introduces first bonus with full explanation of benefits and reason why you're including it. Email #2 introduces second bonus with benefits and reason why. Email #3 recaps both. Later emails remind of all bonuses.

**Kern's Quote:** "As the deadline draws closer to an end, or as the deadline simply draws closer, we add more bonuses to increase that value. So that's what makes it so effective and efficient."

---

### 7.2 Reason Why for Bonuses
**Use When:** Introducing each bonus in countdown emails

After announcing a bonus, always explain why you're giving away something so valuable. Connect it logically to the main offer: "In the consulting class, you'll generate lots of leads. But problem: not all become clients, and you can't take them all. This bonus shows you how to monetize those leads another way."

**Kern's Quote:** "Why would I give away something so valuable? It's simple. In the consulting class, you'll learn how to generate lots of leads for your practice. But there are two problems: 1. Not all of them will become clients. 2. It's not really possible to take them ALL as clients."

---

### 7.2 Reason Why for Deadline
**Use When:** Introducing and reinforcing the deadline in countdown emails

Explain the legitimate business reason for the deadline. Example: "I've decided to keep the class small and not do a launch. It's better this way because I'll be able to answer your questions better and give each student more time and attention. Because of this, I've set a DEADLINE."

**Kern's Quote:** "I've decided to keep the class small and not do a launch. It's better this way because I'll be able to answer your questions better and give each student more time and attention. Because of this, I've set a DEADLINE for registration."

---

### 7.2 Countdown Deadline Timing Structure
**Use When:** Setting up the exact timing for countdown sequence emails

4-day countdown with deadline at midnight on day 4: Email #1 at day 1 (~80 hours before), Email #2 at day 2 (72 hours before), Email #3 at day 3 (48 hours before), Email #4 at day 4 morning (~24 hours before), Email #5 at 12 hours before midnight deadline.

**Kern's Quote:** "Email number four, this goes out one day later. Now the deadline is midnight tomorrow. So technically it's not a full day. I usually have mine go out at seven in the morning."

---

### 7.2 Final 24 Hours Intensity Pattern
**Use When:** Managing the final 24 hours before countdown deadline

In the final 24 hours, shift from value-stacking to urgency-stacking. Email #4 (24 hours out) and Email #5 (12 hours out) use nearly identical body copy but different subject lines emphasizing time remaining. Really hammer the scarcity while reminding of all bonuses.

**Kern's Quote:** "Now is when we really want to start hammering this deadline, right? Because we've got about 24 hours to go here. And that's a big deal. So we've already reminded them of the bonuses and everything. So now it's time to really play up the scarcity, which again needs to be legitimate and real."

---

### 7.2 Timing Between Registration and Webinar
**Use When:** Scheduling webinar dates, optimizing show-up rates, planning campaign timeline

The amount of time that passes between registration and the webinar date itself is VERY significant in terms of making sure people really show up. Too long: they forget. Too short: not enough indoctrination. Optimal timing allows for proper indoctrination without interest fading (typically 5-7 days).

**Kern's Quote:** "What very few people really think about is the amount of time that passes between a registration and the webinar date itself is very, very significant in terms of making sure people really show up."

---

### 7.2 Replay Objection (Anti-Pattern)
**Use When:** Deciding webinar replay strategy, diagnosing why show-up rates are low

DO NOT do replays. If you offer replays, you train people NOT to show up live. They think "I'll just wait for the replay" which they fast-forward through and never really engage with. This destroys live attendance and reduces sales.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you're doing replays, so if my client were doing replays, I would advise them to immediately stop because if you do the replays, it trains people not to show up. Just wait to watch the replay, which of course they just fast forward through and never really get many sales from."

---

### 7.1 Goodwill Continuation Strategy
**Use When:** Understanding why post-webinar emails should continue teaching, not just selling

Post-webinar sequence maintains trust by continuing to help, not just begging for sale. Attendees enjoyed webinar because you made it informative and valuable. Why stop being valuable after webinar ends? Objection videos continue teaching and demonstrate you can help by actually helping them more.

**Kern's Quote:** "Now the reason I did this is first of all to foster goodwill and second of all they just got off of this webinar with me earlier that day. They enjoyed it because I make my webinars very informative using the same process I've already gone through with you and why not continue that goodwill."

---

## Tier 3 - Implementation Tactics (13 frameworks)

### 7.1 Objection Email Formula
**Use When:** Creating follow-up emails that address buying objections through teaching

Structure: (1) Thank them for attending, (2) Frame objection as question you've been getting, (3) Say you created video to answer it, (4) Link to video (use image of video as clickable link for higher CTR), (5) Brief description of what video covers.

**Kern's Quote:** "The purpose of the objection email is simple. You will likely know ahead of time, even before you do your webinar, the main reasons that they won't buy from you... what we want to do in these objection emails is we want to create a video which addresses that objection and overcomes it through education."

---

### 7.1 Video Page Copy Enhancement
**Use When:** Creating the landing page for objection handling videos

Below the video, include written description of what the class entails with bulleted benefits, similar to your order form. Don't make people wait 20+ minutes into the video just to see what they're buying.

**Kern's Quote:** "If I were to do this again, I would also have a written description of what the class entails, like bulleted out, similar to the order form, where I really list out exactly what's in there and list out the bonuses."

---

### 7.1 Objection as Topic Selection
**Use When:** Choosing what to teach in objection-handling videos

Deliberately choose video topics based on objections you know they have. From your brainstorming exercise in Module 1, you identified main reasons they won't buy. Address those through teaching videos.

**Kern's Quote:** "So that's what this video does and I deliberately made it about a topic that I knew they would be concerned about. So the client-centric model is basically the anti-guru model and in the video I actually address it as, 'Hey listen I'm getting a lot of questions of what if I'm not a guru.'"

---

### 7.1 Buyer Exemption from Sales Sequences
**Use When:** Ensuring customers don't receive sales emails after purchasing

In CRM (Infusionsoft or equivalent), set purchase as "end goal" for sales campaign. When someone reaches end goal (purchases), they automatically exit all sales sequences and enter fulfillment sequence instead.

**Kern's Quote:** "If they buy the dang program, then they won't get the next step or the next step... Now if they bought I don't bother them anymore of course I give them the product and let them be happy and help them in that regard."

---

### 7.2 Email Subject Line Preview Optimization
**Use When:** Writing every email in the countdown sequence

Design the first 2-3 lines of email body to work with the subject line as a teaser in email client preview. Example: Subject "NAME: BREAKING NEWS" + first lines "Good news and bad news. Good news first: I've decided..." creates curiosity in the preview pane before they open.

**Kern's Quote:** "When they're looking at this email in their email client, they're going to see name-breaking news. Before they open it, they'll see Frank breaking news, and then they're going to see Frank, good news and bad news, good news first, I've decided, and that's about as much as they'll see."

---

### 7.2 Good News/Bad News Email Frame
**Use When:** Opening countdown sequence emails, especially Email #1

Open with "Good news and bad news. Good news first:" then announce the bonus with excitement and benefits. Then "Now for the bad news:" and introduce the deadline constraints. This frames the deadline as unfortunate but necessary rather than manipulative.

**Kern's Quote:** "Good news and bad news. Good news first: I've decided to include a free LIVE workshop for everyone who attends my advanced consulting class. Now for the bad news: I've decided to keep the class small and not do a launch. This class goes UP BY $1,080 on DATE."

---

### 7.2 PS Bonus Reminder Pattern
**Use When:** Closing every countdown email

Use the PS to remind them of previous bonuses and reinforce scarcity. After Email #2 announces bonus #2, the PS reminds them of bonus #1. The PS is high-readership real estate—use it strategically.

**Kern's Quote:** "P.S. Again - price goes up by $1,080 on DATE if it hasn't sold out already. At this point, I have no plans to teach the class LIVE again. You can enroll here."

---

### 7.2 Email Copy Efficiency Through Reuse
**Use When:** Writing emails #3, #4, and #5 in countdown sequence

After introducing bonuses in emails #1 and #2, emails #3-5 can largely cut and paste the same bonus descriptions. Just change the subject line to reflect increasing urgency and adjust the urgency language in the body.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you go back and look at the other emails, I'm simply cutting and pasting the same explanation of bonuses each time. I put the link down here and then again, reiteration of the deadline."

---

### 7.2 Email #3 Recap Strategy
**Use When:** Creating the third email in countdown sequence (2 days before deadline)

Email #3 is an overview/recap email with no new bonuses announced. Structure: "Quick heads up on some stuff:" then list (1) Recap bonus #1 with benefits and reason why, (2) Recap bonus #2 with benefits and reason why, (3) Restate the deadline with reason why.

**Kern's Quote:** "Email number three, and this goes out now two days before the deadline. And this is the one where we do kind of an overview. So there's no announcement here. We're just kind of remaking aware of the situation."

---

### 7.2 Hyperlinked Call to Action in Countdown
**Use When:** Including links in countdown sequence emails

Make the enrollment call-to-action a hyperlink, not just a URL. Example: "If you want to save $1,080.00, get an additional $10,000.00 in bonuses, and also come to a live workshop with me personally here in La Jolla this fall, enroll here." Include link multiple times—in body and in PS.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you want to save $1,080.00, get an additional $10,000.00 in bonuses, and also come to a live workshop with me personally here in La Jolla this fall, enroll now. Just go to LINK. And I made this as a hyperlink right here."

---

### 7.2 Autoresponder Sequence Management
**Use When:** Setting up the technical infrastructure for post-webinar sequences

The objection handling sequence and countdown sequence are really one continuous autoresponder sequence, though you can separate them visually in your planning. Set up conditional automation: if they buy, move them out of the sequence to fulfillment.

**Kern's Quote:** "Even though you see two boxes here in my funnel, all this is just an autoresponder sequence. So it's not like anything different. I just separate mine out like this because I'm a little bit weird. It's all the same email autoresponder sequence."

---

### 7.2 Subject Line Escalation Pattern
**Use When:** Writing subject lines for the 5-email countdown sequence

Email #1: "NAME: BREAKING NEWS" (curiosity), Email #2: "Like a $10K check payable to ~FirstName~ ~LastName~" (value), Email #3: "NAME FYI" (casual), Email #4: "DEADLINE IS MIDNIGHT" (urgency), Email #5: "PRICE HIKE (12 hours to go)" (maximum urgency).

**Kern's Quote:** "The subject line is deadline is midnight. Frank, the consulting class goes up by 1080 at midnight PST tonight... For email number five, the final email is 12 hours before the deadline hits. And it'll say price hike 12 hours to go."

---

### 7.3 Webinar Attendee Segmentation Logic
**Use When:** Determining which post-webinar sequence to send to which people

Only send the post-webinar sequence (objection handling + countdown) to people who (1) attended the webinar live, AND (2) did not purchase during or immediately after the webinar. People who registered but didn't attend get different follow-up.

**Kern's Quote:** "Remember, there's nothing wrong with uploading these guys because they're on your list anyway, right? They opted in to get on the webinar, so obviously it's okay for you to upload them. All you're really doing is just getting the guys who attended so you can email just them."

---

### 7.3 Technical Timing Flexibility Principle
**Use When:** Implementing post-webinar sequences and worrying about exact timing

Don't be a stickler about exact timing of email sends. Send the first objection video same day as webinar or as soon as possible. Send subsequent emails about a day apart. Consistency and completion matter more than precision.

**Kern's Quote:** "We sent it to them the day of the webinar or as soon as we could. No need to be too much of a stickler about timing on that. And then we send another one a day or so after."

---

### 7.3 Data Cleanup for CRM Upload
**Use When:** Preparing GoToWebinar export files for CRM import

GoToWebinar exports include many fields CRMs don't need. Delete everything except the three critical fields: First Name, Last Name, Email. Delete header rows above the column names. Save as CSV or Excel depending on CRM requirements.

**Kern's Quote:** "All this stuff, basically everything above the blue I don't want. I'm just going to right click it here and I'm going to say delete selected rows. I don't need to know the attendee guys, the yes column and the interest rating and all that stuff. Now I just have their first name, last name, and email."

---

### 7.4 CRM Integration Simplicity (API Key Method)
**Use When:** Integrating landing page builder with email service

Integrating landing pages with email services is simple despite sounding technical. Get your API key from email service (Settings > Application), paste into landing page builder integration field, add account name if required, click connect. Takes 1-2 minutes.

**Kern's Quote:** "All you do in this thing is it asks you for a little piece of code. It's literally like a string of numbers that Infusionsoft or Aweber or any of them. It's called their API code. They'll give it to you in their little platform there, and you just paste it in a little box here and say integrate. It's literally like a one-minute thing."

---

## Tier 4 - Supporting Details (20 frameworks)

### 7.2 High-Open Subject Lines
**Use When:** Writing subject lines for post-webinar emails

Two proven high-open subject lines: (1) "For [NAME]" - personalizes without being salesy, (2) "[Name]!" - just their first name with exclamation point. Both get "huge open rates" because they're personal and curious.

**Kern's Quote:** "Now, this is a big deal with the subject line. This gets huge open rates. Like, no need to try to be fancy in your subject line. So feel free to swipe that really universally. Another one that gets extremely good open rates is simply their name with an exclamation point after it."

---

### 7.2 Video Thumbnail Link Strategy
**Use When:** Linking to videos in post-webinar emails

Put image of your video (screenshot showing you on video) in email and make entire image clickable link to video. Gets higher click-through rate than text link alone. Credit to Brendan Burchard for popularizing this as best practice.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you put a little image of your video in the email and make that image clickable, you'll get a pretty high click through rate on your email and usually higher than you would get if you didn't do it."

---

### 7.1 Deadline Introduction in Email 2
**Use When:** Second objection email, building urgency while continuing to provide value

After main content of second email, add P.S. introducing deadline: "P.S. DEADLINE IS APPROACHING. Looks like the price for [product] is going up by at least $[amount] on [DATE]." This introduces urgency without making entire email about deadline.

**Kern's Quote:** "P.S. DEADLINE IS APPROACHING. Looks like the price for the consulting class is going up by at LEAST $900 on [DATE HERE]. I've added some new bonuses and you can see them at the end of the video, as well as hear my 'evil scheme' confession lol."

---

### 7.2 Comprehensive Case Study Disclaimers
**Use When:** Including success stories or case studies in post-webinar content

After mentioning case study, include detailed disclaimers covering: (1) Not typical results, (2) Person worked with you privately (if true), (3) They worked extremely hard, (4) Kept trying despite obstacles, (5) Most people don't do that, (6) Required hard work and experience, (7) You have no idea what their results will be.

**Kern's Quote:** "Please don't take this case study as an even remotely typical result. The guy I mention didn't take my class, he was a private client. He also worked like crazy, and kept on trying even after he hit major obstacles... Most people don't do that. They just gather info and 'get ready' to work ...or they throw in the towel and quit at the first bump in the road."

---

### 7.2 Manual vs Automated Attendee Upload
**Use When:** Moving attendees from GoToWebinar into your post-webinar sequence

After webinar: (1) Download attendee list from GoToWebinar, (2) Upload into Infusionsoft (or CRM), (3) Tag them to trigger post-webinar campaign. Kern does this manually, not automated: "Usually it'll be a couple hours or whatever. I don't do it immediately. I don't automate it. I like to do it personally."

**Kern's Quote:** "Right after the webinar occurs, I like to download all of the attendees from GoToWebinar and upload them back into Infusionsoft and put them in one of these little campaigns... I don't do it immediately. I don't automate it. I like to do it personally. I'm just sort of somewhat distrustful of technology."

---

### 7.3 Tech-Free Integration Philosophy
**Use When:** Choosing tools and platforms, deciding whether to integrate systems

Kern's philosophy: Keep technical stuff as simple as possible. Don't integrate services just because you can. Example: Instead of integrating GoToWebinar with email service and landing page builders (complex 3-way integration), just set up basic web form that goes to email service, and manually add registrants to GoToWebinar.

**Kern's Quote:** "GoToWebinar had a little GoToWebinar integration disruption, which caused a little bit of trouble. But it would not have caused trouble with us because we don't use that added layer of unnecessary technicality."

---

### 7.3 GoToWebinar Attendee Export Process
**Use When:** Extracting webinar attendee data to upload to your CRM after a webinar

In GoToWebinar: (1) Go to 'My Webinars', (2) Click 'Webinar History', (3) Choose the specific webinar, (4) Click the plus button next to 'Attended Live', (5) Generate attendee report (Excel or CSV), (6) Download and open the file, (7) Delete all rows above the blue header row, (8) Delete all columns except First Name, Last Name, and Email.

**Kern's Quote:** "You go to my webinars first. I'm going to go to webinar history. You choose the webinar that you wanted to have. You see you have this attended live. You want to click this little plus button right here. And we want to generate an attendee report."

### 7.3 Manual Upload Method for Infusionsoft
**Use When:** Adding webinar attendees to Infusionsoft CRM after cleaning the export

After cleaning your GoToWebinar export to just first name, last name, and email, upload the file to Infusionsoft. Tag the uploaded contacts as "webinar attendees" with the specific date. Place them into your post-webinar autoresponder sequence.

**Kern's Quote:** "That is the most low tech way to do it. That's how I personally do it. I like just to go and export my attendees and then import them back into Infusionsoft."

---

### 7.3 Automated Integration via PlusThis (Infusionsoft)
**Use When:** Automating the GoToWebinar to Infusionsoft integration

Use PlusThis (plusthis.com) plugin to connect GoToWebinar with Infusionsoft via API. It automatically tags everyone as an attendee and places them in the campaign sequence without manual export/import.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you use Infusionsoft, there is a plugin called PlusThis. They have a little thing that'll talk to GoToWebinar, and it'll sort of somehow, via use of API magic, tag everyone as an attendee and place them automatically in the campaign sequence."

---

### 7.3 Automated Integration via Zapier (Aweber/GetResponse)
**Use When:** Automating GoToWebinar integration with Aweber or GetResponse

Use Zapier (zapier.com) to create a "Zap" that integrates GoToWebinar with your email platform. Search for "Zapier integrate [your platform] and GoToWebinar" to find the pre-built integration. Set it to add attendees to a specific list after the webinar finishes.

**Kern's Quote:** "You can also automate it if you use something like AWeber or GetResponse. And this is a little tool called Zapier. What Zapier does is it's like some sort of third-party magical thingy tech thing that integrates two tech things together."

---

### 7.3 Platform Comparison for Automation
**Use When:** Choosing between different automation methods for your platform

Infusionsoft: Can upload manually OR use PlusThis for automation. Aweber/GetResponse: Cannot upload manually (or it's very limited), must use Zapier for automation. iContact: Can upload manually (last Frank checked). Choose your automation method based on your email platform's capabilities.

**Kern's Quote:** "If you use Infusionsoft, you can totally upload it to Infusionsoft, tag them as webinar attendees for that date, and drop them in your autoresponder sequence. Same thing goes with some applications like Eye Contact, for example, last I checked, they would still let you upload stuff."

### 7.3 Zapier Integration URLs Reference
**Use When:** Setting up automated integrations between GoToWebinar and email platforms

Direct URLs for Zapier integrations: Aweber + GoToWebinar integration at https://zapier.com/zapbook/aweber/gotowebinar/. GetResponse + GoToWebinar integration at https://zapier.com/zapbook/getresponse/gotowebinar/. For Infusionsoft automation, use PlusThis at http://www.plusthis.com.

**Kern's Quote:** "Aweber Automation: https://zapier.com/zapbook/aweber/gotowebinar/ GetResponse Automation: https://zapier.com/zapbook/getresponse/gotowebinar/ Infusionsoft Automation: http://www.plusthis.com"

### 7.2 Email Timing Optimization
**Use When:** Scheduling when post-webinar emails send

Email 1: Same day as webinar (within hours). Email 2: Following morning at 10am Eastern / 7am Pacific. This timing based on testing by Ryan Deiss at Digital Marketer - highest open rates in this timeframe.

**Kern's Quote:** "I like to send this one the following morning and I like to program my email to go out 10 a.m. Eastern Time and 7 a.m. Pacific Time. I think that kind of gets a pretty good open rate there. Ryan Dice actually studied it a pretty good bit."

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Webinar Follow-Up
"I just finished my first webinar and only got 3 sales out of 200 attendees. What do I do?"

**Deploy:**
1. 7.0 Complete Post-Webinar Funnel Architecture (understand the system)
2. 7.1 Post-Webinar Objection Sequence Structure (create 2 videos)
3. 7.1 Objection as Topic Selection (choose topics based on questions asked during webinar)
4. 7.2 Countdown Sequence Architecture (plan the 4-day sequence)
5. 7.3 GoToWebinar Attendee Export Process (get the list)
6. 7.3 Manual Upload Method (simple start without automation)

### Scenario 2: Objection Video Not Converting
"I sent an objection handling video but nobody bought. Did I do it wrong?"

**Check:**
1. 7.1 Teaching-to-Pitch Ratio for Video #2 (60% teaching, 40% selling?)
2. 7.1 Video Opening Recency Pattern (did you hook them in first 35 seconds?)
3. 7.1 Positioning Against What They Hate (did you differentiate from competitors?)
4. 7.1 Demonization of the Objection (can you show what they think they need actually hurts them?)
5. 7.1 Goodwill Continuation Strategy (are you being genuinely helpful?)
6. 7.1 Long-Term Relationship Thinking (remember: even if they don't buy now, goodwill pays off later)

### Scenario 3: Low Email Open Rates
"My countdown emails aren't getting opened. Subject lines aren't working."

**Apply:**
1. 7.2 High-Open Subject Lines ("For [NAME]" and "[Name]!" formulas)
2. 7.2 Subject Line Escalation Pattern (curiosity → value → urgency progression)
3. 7.2 Email Subject Line Preview Optimization (first lines work with subject as teaser)
4. 7.2 Email Timing Optimization (10am ET / 7am PT sweet spot)

### Scenario 4: Technical Setup Overwhelm
"The integrations and automation are stopping me from launching. Too complicated."

**Use:**
1. 7.3 Tech-Free Integration Philosophy (simple over automated)
2. 7.3 Manual Upload Method for Infusionsoft (low-tech reliable option)
3. 7.3 Technical Timing Flexibility Principle (don't be a stickler, just do it)
4. 7.3 Data Cleanup for CRM Upload (simple 3-field format)
5. 7.4 CRM Integration Simplicity (API key method takes 1-2 minutes)

### Scenario 5: Buyers Still Getting Sales Emails
"Customers are complaining they keep getting 'buy now' emails after they already purchased."

**Fix:**
1. 7.1 Buyer Exemption from Sales Sequences (set purchase as end goal in CRM)
2. 7.2 Autoresponder Sequence Management (conditional automation setup)

### Scenario 6: Weak Deadline (Nobody Believes It)
"I set a deadline but people don't believe it's real. Sales come in after deadline asking for exception."

**Rebuild:**
1. 7.2 Legitimate Deadline Options (price hike or true unavailability only)
2. 7.2 Reason Why for Deadline (business constraint that serves them)
3. Technical enforcement via Scarcity Samurai or Infusionsoft link expiration
4. NEVER extend deadline - credibility is gone if you do

## The Kern Post-Webinar Philosophy

### On Reality
"I'm not expecting most people on a webinar to make a snap decision to give me a lot of money. I know they're going to need more information. They're going to have objections and they're going to need some more incentive to buy."

### On Goodwill
"They enjoyed the webinar because I make my webinars very informative. Why not continue that goodwill and continue to demonstrate you can help them by actually helping them?"

### On Long-Term Thinking
"Even if they don't buy from this whole campaign, if I maintain that goodwill, they will eventually buy something."

### On Replays
"If you do replays, it trains people not to show up. They just wait for the replay, which they fast-forward through and never really get many sales from."

### On Technical Complexity
"Keep technical stuff as simple as possible. Don't integrate services just because you can. The goal is implementation and revenue, not technical elegance."

### On Demonization
"One of the great unifiers of all mankind is to have a common thing to stand against as well as a common thing to stand for."

### On Compound Pressure
"We could exponentially compound the level of pressure by simultaneously piling on more value as the deadline grew closer." (Scarcity + Greed)

### On Results
"Just doing this has dramatically increased my closing from webinars. My value per attendee has gone up tremendously."

*This is Kern's OTHER CROWN JEWEL. Most presenters ignore post-webinar follow-up entirely. Master this system and you'll convert the 80%+ who attended but didn't buy immediately.*
