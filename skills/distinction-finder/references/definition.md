# What Is a Distinction — Quick Reference

A distinction is a **perceptual capacity created through language** that permanently alters what you can see — and therefore what you can do.

## Five Properties

1. **Perceptual, not informational** — changes seeing, not knowing
2. **Created in language** — the right words create new perceptual categories
3. **Binary at the core** — A vs Not-A; the boundary IS the distinction
4. **Irreversible once acquired** — like riding a bicycle
5. **Enables action without prescribing it** — shows what's there; you choose what to do

## The Hierarchy

```
DISTINCTIONS (atomic perceptual units)
    → MENTAL MODELS (connected sets)
        → FRAMEWORKS (structured systems)
            → METHODOLOGIES (complete operational systems)
```
