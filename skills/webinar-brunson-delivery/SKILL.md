# Brunson Delivery Frameworks

Presentation craft and delivery frameworks for the Perfect Webinar system. These are about HOW you present, not WHAT you present.

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding trial closes to boost conversion (documented 70% revenue increase)
- Building slides from the Perfect Webinar template
- Making script delivery feel natural rather than robotic
- Understanding the difference between Perfect Webinar vs Story Selling Webinar
- Learning webinar craft from multiple masters
- Ensuring FTC compliance with income claims
- Understanding the apprenticeship path to webinar mastery

**Critical Insight:** Trial closes alone increased Russell's profit per registrant from $9.40 to $16 (nearly doubled) by creating constant micro-agreement momentum.

## Frameworks Included (17)

### Tier 1 - Foundation Principles
- **Trial Closes (Micro-Agreements)** - Constant yes-momentum throughout presentation

### Tier 2 - Core Frameworks
- **Trial Close Insertion Points (High-Value Moments)** - Where to drop 5-6 trial closes
- **Trial Close Impact Evidence** - $9.40 → $16 per registrant case study
- **The Pied Piper Effect (Head Nodding Wave)** - What mastery looks like
- **Trial Close Language Pattern Integration** - Making trial closes natural
- **Trial Close Density Strategy** - Every 10 seconds at mastery level

### Tier 3 - Implementation Tactics
- **Trial Close Examples (Question Bank)** - "Isn't that awesome?" ready-to-use phrases
- **Testimonial Trial Close Sequence** - 5-6 questions after each testimonial
- **Trial Close Automation** - Optimizing automated webinars in post-production
- **Perfect Webinar vs Story Selling Webinar** - When to use each format
- **Script as Framework Principle** - Flexible delivery, not robotic reading

### Tier 4 - Advanced & Supporting
- **The Slide-By-Slide Template Build Process** - Building FROM template, not retrofitting
- **The Apprenticeship Learning Path** - How Russell learned from 15+ mentors
- **The Humiliation-Driven Breakthrough** - Two failures before humility arrived

- **FTC Disclaimer Integration** - Legal safety after income claims
- **The Loneliness of Entrepreneurship** - Why community and events matter

## How to Use

### 1. Add Trial Closes to Existing Webinar

**The documented 70% revenue increase came from this:**

1. Watch your webinar recording (or review script)
2. Identify insertion points:
   - After every testimonial/success story
   - After revealing each secret
   - Every 10 seconds at mastery level
3. Use the question bank: "Isn't that awesome?" "Can you see how this would help?" "Does that make sense?"
4. Record trial closes and insert (for automated webinars)
5. Measure conversion lift

**Critical:** After testimonials, drop 5-6 trial closes in a row. Don't just move on.

### 2. Build Slides from Template

1. Print Perfect Webinar template sheet
2. Place next to computer
3. Open slide software
4. Build slides DIRECTLY from template, section by section
5. Each template element gets corresponding slide(s)

**Don't:** Build slides freely then try to retrofit template. Elements get missed and flow breaks.

### 3. Master Natural Delivery

1. Use script as framework, not word-for-word
2. Add your personality, current events, improvisation between framework elements
3. Know the framework so well you can explain it without reading
4. Trial closes become "just how you speak" through repetition

### 4. Choose Right Webinar Format

- **Story Selling Webinar:** Getting them to do NEXT thing (sign up, take next step in funnel)
- **Perfect Webinar:** Direct sale of $1,000-$2,000+ package

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework descriptions.

## Trial Closes Deep Dive

### What Are Trial Closes?

Micro-questions that get the audience to say "yes" mentally or physically (nodding heads). They create agreement momentum that makes the final yes easier.

### The Impact

Russell's automated webinar went from $9.40 to $16 profit per registrant just by systematically adding trial closes. That's a 70% revenue increase from one technique.

### The Question Bank

Keep these handy (write on note cards initially):
- "Does that make sense?"
- "Isn't that awesome?"
- "Are you guys getting this?"
- "Isn't this exciting?"
- "Can you see how this would help you?"
- "Can you imagine what it'd be like if..."
- "Wouldn't that be great if..."
- "Don't you think?"
- "Just imagine how it would change your life."

### High-Value Insertion Points

**After Testimonials (Most Important):**
1. Share the testimonial
2. "Isn't that awesome what happened?"
3. "Can you imagine if you got that result?"
4. "What would that mean for you?"
5. "How would your life change?"
6. "Would your spouse look at you differently?"
7. "Wouldn't that be great?"
8. THEN move on

**After Big Secrets:**
- Drop 5-6 trial closes after revealing each secret
- These are high-interest moments
- Multiple micro-agreements compound the effect

### Density at Mastery

At Ted Thomas "The Pied Piper" level: entire audience's heads look like a wave from the back of the room. Everyone nodding constantly for 90 minutes.

At Russell's current level: dropping trial closes every 10 seconds unconsciously.

### The Learning Path

**Stage 1:** Write trial closes on note cards, place around desk
**Stage 2:** Consciously insert them at key moments
**Stage 3:** They become unconscious - "just how you speak"

### For Automated Webinars

1. Watch entire recording
2. Identify every spot for trial close
3. Record yourself saying each one
4. Have editor insert throughout
5. This surgical optimization is how Russell went from $9.40 to $16

## The Slide Building Process

### The Template Method

**Critical:** Don't build slides then try to fit template. Build FROM template.

1. **Print template** - Have it physically next to you
2. **Build section by section** - Template shows concept on left, application on right
3. **One-to-one mapping** - Each template element gets corresponding slide(s)
4. **No skipping** - Physical template prevents missing elements

**Why this works:** Template elements are in psychologically optimal sequence. Skipping or reordering breaks flow.

## Script as Framework

### The Principle

The script is a framework, not word-for-word document. You add things in between based on:
- Your personality
- Current events
- The moment
- Your energy

### The Test

Can you explain the framework elements (the one thing, three secrets, stack, closes) without reading?

If yes: you understand it as framework.
If no: you're still memorizing, not internalizing.

### Natural vs Robotic

**Robotic:** Following script verbatim
**Natural:** Using script as framework, improvising around it while hitting key psychological points

## Perfect Webinar vs Story Selling Webinar

### Story Selling Webinar

**Purpose:** Get them to do the NEXT thing
**Use when:**
- Sign up for invisible funnel
- Take next step in sequence
- Bridge to next stage

**Not for:** Direct high-ticket sales

### Perfect Webinar

**Purpose:** Direct sale of $1,000-$2,000+ package
**Use when:**
- Selling complete program
- High-ticket offer
- Standalone conversion event

**Structure:** The one thing → 3 secrets → stack → close

## The Apprenticeship Path

### How Russell Built This System

1. Bought every course from every master in the field
2. Studied each one thoroughly
3. Extracted one piece/technique/insight from each
4. Layered those pieces together
5. Synthesized into single system

**Masters studied:** Armand Morin, Bill Glazer, Dan Kennedy, Jason Fladlien, Ted Thomas, plus ~10 others.

### The Investment Mindset

Russell paid $10,000-15,000 to Speaking Empire not just to get a webinar, but to **see their process**.

**High-value learning:** Pay to observe methodology
**Low-value learning:** Pay just to get result

Process knowledge compounds infinitely. Result is one-time.

### The Humiliation Lesson

**First presentation:** Best content, best stories, best ideas. More value than anyone. Zero sales.
→ Three days hiding in hotel room from embarrassment.

**Second presentation:** Still tried to outsmart system ("I won't do that cheesy price drop"). Zero sales.
→ Three more days hiding.

**Breakthrough:** Only after two complete public humiliations did humility arrive. Only then started buying courses, asking questions, learning from proven winners.

**Lesson:** Humble yourself BEFORE the failures, not after.

## FTC Disclaimer Integration

### When to Use

After making income claims or showing specific results.

### How to Integrate

Keep it brief and conversational:
- "Results are not typical, this is not gonna work for everyone"
- "Blah, blah, blah, just to keep yourself kind of safe"

**Don't:** Turn it into a legal lecture. It should feel like a quick aside.

**Example:** "Last 14 days, I did over six figures in high-ticket products, I didn't pick up the phone. [INSERT DISCLAIMER] Now let me show you how..."

## The Loneliness Principle

### Why This Matters

Being an entrepreneur is the loneliest job in the world. Nobody understands what you do, who you are, or why you're passionate about "crazy ideas."

This is **universal**, not unique to you.

### The Solution

Events, masterminds, communities - room full of people who look at life the way you do.

This isn't "nice to have" - it's psychologically necessary for sustainable entrepreneurship.

### Russell's First Event

Paid $2,000 (last of his money) not for knowledge but for **connection with tribe**.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Not Using Trial Closes
- Leaving 70% revenue increase on the table
- Missing the easiest conversion optimization available

### Mistake #2: Building Slides Before Template
- Skipping critical elements
- Breaking psychological flow
- Trying to retrofit instead of building from foundation

### Mistake #3: Reading Script Word-for-Word
- Sounds robotic
- Kills authenticity
- Script is framework, not teleprompter

### Mistake #4: Skipping Testimonial Trial Closes
- Most people share testimonial and move on
- Should drop 5-6 trial closes after each one
- This is a high-value insertion point

### Mistake #5: Forgetting FTC Disclaimers
- Legal risk after income claims
- Easy fix: brief conversational disclaimer

## Validation Questions

**Before going live:**
- Have I inserted trial closes throughout? (Especially after testimonials?)
- Did I build slides FROM template or try to retrofit?
- Can I explain the framework without reading script?
- Do I know when to use Perfect Webinar vs Story Selling Webinar?
- Have I added FTC disclaimers after income claims?

## The Trial Close Optimization Workflow

**For existing webinar:**

1. **Watch/review entire presentation**
2. **Mark insertion points:**
   - After every testimonial (5-6 trial closes each)
   - After every secret reveal (5-6 trial closes each)
   - Additional spots every 10-20 seconds
3. **Record trial closes** (for automated webinars)
4. **Insert systematically**
5. **Test conversion lift**
6. **Iterate to every 10 seconds** (mastery level)

**Expected result:** 50-70% conversion increase based on Russell's evidence.
