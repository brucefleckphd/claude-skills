# Evaldo Leads

Evaldo Albuquerque's lead frameworks. The lead is the first 10-20% of your copy - everything before the pitch. It must HOOK them, build BELIEF, and create DESIRE before you ever mention the product.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing VSL or sales letter opening
- Lead isn't holding attention
- Need to establish credibility fast
- Building toward the pitch
- First 5-10 minutes of any VSL

## Crown Jewels

1. **The 10 Questions Structure** - Complete VSL framework (leads answer first 6)
2. **The Punch in the Gut Opening** - Immediate emotional impact
3. **The Three Story Types** - Guru, Little Guy, Common Enemy
4. **The Inception Technique** - Let them draw the conclusion

## Complete Workflow

2. **Establish relevance** - Why this matters to them
3. **Build credibility** - Why listen to you
4. **Tell the story** - Guru, little guy, or enemy
5. **Introduce mechanism** - The new way (tease it)
6. **Create desire** - What's possible for them
7. **Transition to body** - Set up the 10 Questions

## Critical Evaldo Quote

> "The lead is where you earn the right to sell. If you haven't built
> enough belief and desire by the end of the lead, no pitch will save
> you. The lead does 80% of the selling."
