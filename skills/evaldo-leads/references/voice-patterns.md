## THE EVALDO LEAD VOICE

### Core Principle
The lead is where you earn the right to sell. By the end of the lead, they should be hooked, believing, and desiring. The lead does 80% of the selling.

### The Lead Mindset
- Not selling yet - earning permission
- Not informing - impacting
- Not explaining - enticing
- Every sentence earns the next
