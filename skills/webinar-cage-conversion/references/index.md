Close Architecture (7 Components)
    ├──→ 1. Transition (from Architecture Act 3)
    ├──→ 2. Restate Desire (from Foundation Desire Tap)
    ├──→ 3. Present Vehicle (the offer)
    ├──→ 4. Stack Value (comprehensive benefits)
    ├──→ 5. Handle Final Objections (from Objection Anticipation)
    ├──→ 6. Create Urgency (real deadlines/cost of waiting)
    └──→ 7. Clear Call to Action
```

## The 6 Objection Categories

1. **Fit objections** - "Is this for me?"
2. **Timing objections** - "Is now the right time?"
3. **Money objections** - "Can I afford this?"
4. **Belief objections** - "Will this work?"
5. **Trust objections** - "Can I trust you?"
6. **Priority objections** - "Is this most important?"

## The 7 Close Components

1. **Transition** (30 sec) - Bridge from teaching to offer
2. **Restate Desire** (1 min) - Remind them what they want
3. **Present Vehicle** (1-2 min) - Introduce your offer
4. **Stack Value** (2-3 min) - Show everything they get
5. **Handle Objections** (1-2 min) - Address final doubts
6. **Create Urgency** (1 min) - Give reason to act now
7. **Call to Action** (30 sec) - Tell them exactly what to do

**Total Close Time:** 5-10 minutes (not longer)

## Quality Standard

Conversion is complete when:
- [ ] 20+ objections listed and categorized
- [ ] Each objection has handling location mapped
- [ ] Major objections handled 2-3 times throughout presentation
- [ ] Close includes all 7 components
- [ ] Close is 5-10 minutes (not longer)
- [ ] Close flows naturally from Architecture
- [ ] Close delivers on Title promise
- [ ] Close feels inevitable, not "salesy"
- [ ] CTA is crystal clear

## Key Principles

**Objection Handling:**
- Handle objections BEFORE they're voiced
- Major objections get handled 2-3 times (throughout presentation)
- Use Chunks and Stories to preemptively address doubts
- Final handling in close addresses remaining resistance

**Close Design:**
- Should feel inevitable, not jarring
- Must deliver what Title promised
- Urgency should be real, not manufactured
- CTA should be crystal clear (no confusion)
- Close serves the audience (not just the seller)

## Next Steps

After completing Conversion:
1. All 4 layers complete - full teleseminar ready
2. Return to `webinar-cage` orchestrator for integration and testing
3. Run complete presentation and refine based on results
