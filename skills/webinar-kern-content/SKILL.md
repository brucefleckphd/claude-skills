# Kern Content Frameworks

Teaching and demonstration frameworks for creating the BOND and PAYOFF sections where you genuinely help prospects.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating the PAYOFF section where you teach 3-4 core things
- Structuring the BOND section with personal story
- Creating any marketing videos (not just webinars)
- Deciding what level of detail to teach
- Balancing actionable content with avoiding boring details
- Understanding why demonstration beats testimonials beats claims
- Creating slides for teaching sections

## Frameworks Included (25)

### Master Principles (Ace/King)
- **C1. PAYOFF - Three Forms of Influence Hierarchy** - Demonstration > Testimonials > Claims
- **C2. It's About Them, Not You** - Talk more about THEM than yourself, their outcome than your stuff
- **C3. Tutorial Over Hype Principle** - Position as tutorial, teach 3 major things, feels better and sells better
- **C4. Ladder of Desire Framework** - Do it FOR me > Do it WITH me > Give me the manual

### Core Teaching Frameworks (Queen/Jack)
- **C5. Payoff Core Purpose** - Demonstrate you can help by actually helping them
- **C6. X Steps to Y Formula** - Structure as numbered steps (3-5 typically)
- **C7. Actionable vs Bog-Free Balance** - Actionable but not boring details
- **C8. Reason Why Advertising** - Always explain WHY, not just what
- **C9. Proof Through Helping (Not Claims)** - Teach to demonstrate capability

### Video & Attention Frameworks (10s)
- **C10. Kern's Three-Step Video Formula** - Pattern Interrupt → Payoff → CTA
- **C11. The 9-Second Rule** - You have 9 seconds to grab attention and sell next segment
- **C12. Questions Cannot Be Ignored** - Brain cannot ignore questions, directs focus
- **C13. Focus Control Through Questions** - What-if questions force mental pictures
- **C14. 'Imagine This Scenario' Pattern Interrupt** - Causes reflection, then questions take control

### Story & Connection (10s)
- **C15. BOND Story Framework** - The Roadmap section sets up payoff content
- **C16. Feel-Felt-Found Through Story** - They feel → You felt same → You found solution
- **C17. Story as Metaphor for Point** - Stories make points more efficiently than statements
- **C18. Feel-Felt-Found Formula** - Address skepticism with empathy

### Slide & Structure Frameworks (10s)
- **C19. Title Slide with Bullet Points Structure** - Simple slides work ($100/attendee proof)
- **C20. Concept and Supporting Bullets Pattern** - Concept title → 3-5 bullets → Example
- **C21. Big Statement Emphasis Slides** - Single powerful statement, no bullets
- **C22. Boxes and Squares Visual Simplicity** - Simple process flows brain can lock onto
- **C23. Situation-Solutions Worksheet Application** - Build content from your research

### Supporting Tactical Frameworks (10s)
- **C24. Avoid Bogging in Teaching** - Overview without excessive technicality
- **C25. Demonstration > Everything** - Show, don't just tell or collect testimonials

## How to Use

1. **Understand Core Philosophy** - Use C1-C4 (Master Principles) to grasp Kern's teaching approach
2. **Structure Your Teaching** - Use C6 (X Steps to Y) to organize payoff as 3-5 pillars
3. **Create Slides** - Use C19-C22 for simple, effective slide structure
4. **Balance Detail** - Use C7 (Actionable vs Bog-Free) to decide what to teach
5. **Add Story** - Use C15-C18 for BOND section and feel-felt-found patterns
6. **Video Creation** - Use C10-C14 for any video content
7. **Throughout** - Keep C2 (It's About Them) as constant filter

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Core Content Principle

**Help by actually helping:**

```
THREE FORMS OF INFLUENCE (Ascending Power):
1. What YOU say about your stuff         (Lowest - Claims)
2. What OTHERS say about your stuff      (Medium - Testimonials)
3. What you DEMONSTRATE about your stuff (Highest - Teaching)

PAYOFF STRUCTURE:
"The 5 Pillars of [Desired Result]"

Pillar 1: [Concept Title Slide]
  → Supporting bullets (3-5)
  → Example or diagram
  → Emphasis slide (optional)

Pillar 2-5: Repeat pattern

BALANCE:
✓ Teach fundamentals, patterns, examples
✓ Show what to build and why
✗ Don't bog with HTML editing, code generation
✗ Don't walk through boring technical details
```

## The Video Formula

```
PATTERN INTERRUPT (9 seconds)
- Ask question (brain cannot ignore)
- Grab attention
- Sell watching next segment
    ↓
PAYOFF (Bulk of video)
- About THEM, not you
- Their desired outcome
- Show outcome, educate how
- Talk 3x more about them than you
    ↓
CALL TO ACTION (Clear ask)
- Every video has purpose
- Beneficial reason to act NOW
- What's the next step?
```

## Kern's Teaching Balance

**What to teach:**
- Headline formulas (YES)
- Winning layouts (YES)
- Button colors (YES)
- Examples of working pages (YES)
- Strategic concepts (YES)

**What NOT to teach:**
- HTML editing walkthrough (NO - say "use Dreamweaver or Leadpages")
- Opt-in code generation (NO - boring technical)
- Every tiny implementation detail (NO - overwhelms)

**Result:** They understand concept deeply, see how to apply it, know what tools they need, aren't bored.

## The Slide Philosophy

From Kern's $140K webinar with 1,500 attendees ($100/attendee):

- No fancy graphics needed
- Title + 3-5 bullet points works
- Occasional single-statement emphasis slide
- Simple boxes/arrows for process flows
- You're there to teach, not dazzle with design
- Test with simple first, add fancy later if you want
