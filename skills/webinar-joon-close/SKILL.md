# Joon Close Frameworks

Peng Joon's comprehensive closing system - from stack building to table rush mechanics to psychology principles learned from masters like Myron Golden and Tony Robbins.

## When to Use This Skill
- Building offer stacks (DIY → Done-With-You → Done-For-You)
- Executing table rush at live events
- High-ticket application closes
- Using anchoring and psychology techniques
- Post-close re-close session planning
- Bonus marinade during content

## Core Philosophy
"Your close, a good close is never about the close. It is your entire presentation. How you delivered value, how you served them at the highest levels in terms of their beliefs, their motivation, their fears."

5. Dabbler Problem Frame
6. Value Demonstration Through Team Videos
7. Application Close (High-Ticket)

10. Choir Director Participation Close

### Tier 3 (Advanced)
11. Tony Robbins Anchoring Strategy

## Framework Details

### 1. Done-With-You / Done-For-You Stack Building
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Value Hierarchy:**
```
DIY (Do It Yourself) - Lowest perceived value, most competitive
  ↓
Done-With-You - Templates, blueprints, coaching calls
  ↓
Done-For-You - Scripts, resources, implementation support (Highest value)
```

**Key Question:** "How can I make heavy lifting done FOR them?"

**Examples:**
- Event Flow Manual = Done-For-You (saves countless hours)
- PowerPoint templates = Done-For-You
- Weekly coaching calls = Done-With-You

**Source Quote:** "If you want to start charging more for your products, programs, and services, we need to start thinking about how can we offer more done with you and done for you."

---

### 2. Bonus Marinade (Establish Value Early)
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Problem:**
```
WRONG: Build stack → reveal price → explain bonuses (energy dips)
RIGHT: During teaching, introduce bonus as content example
```

**Steps:**
1. During teaching, introduce bonus as content example
2. Build value: "This motivated seller report gets you 30% below market"
3. Ask: "If you bought one property 30% below market, worth $20K?"
4. Leave it visible (flip chart or stage)
5. At close: "Remember this? First 17 people get it"
6. No need to re-explain - value already established

**Why It Works:** Build value when resistance is low (during teaching). At close, just reference it.

**Source Quote:** "This is a game changer. You build the value of these bonuses way before your close."

---

### 3. Table Rush Three-Step Progression
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Progression:**
```
Step 1: Universal question → Hand raise (get 100% hands up)
Step 2: "If you raised hand, stand up" → Get 100% standing
Step 3: "First X people to tables for bonuses" → Create movement
```

**Key Principles:**
- Table rush is just mechanism - whole presentation was the close
- Progression reduces risk/embarrassment at each step
- Standing people = majority. Sitting = minority (social pressure)
- 10% closing rate is decent in cold multi-speaker events

**Source Quote:** "If you did a decent job with your event where you served them at the highest level, this really doesn't matter, this is just a mechanic."

---

### 4. Coaching Program Video Demonstration
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate coaching philosophy and show real support team

**The Technique:**
Use third-party video (e.g., Simon Cowell/Shaheen) to illustrate coaching philosophy: "Great coach says not good enough when world is clapping."

**Why It Works:**
- Shows high standards = high value
- Positions you as demanding coach who gets results
- Third-party validation more credible than self-claim

**Application:** During program description, before price reveal

---

### 5. Dabbler Problem Frame
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Problem Pattern:**
```
Event → Motivation peak → Return home → Old environment → Fade
```

**The Frame:**
"Most people are dabblers. When we leave, you'll go back to same friends, same life. This 6-month program prevents that."

**Why It Works:**
- Acknowledges common pattern (they've experienced it)
- Positions program as solution to inevitable fade
- Creates urgency for ongoing support

**Application:** Before introducing continuity/coaching offer

---

### 6. Value Demonstration Through Team Videos
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Technique:**
30-second videos of real team members:
- "Hi, I'm [name]"
- "I handle [role]"
- "I'll be helping you with [result]"

**Why It Works:**
- Shows real cost = real value
- Proves program has infrastructure
- Humanizes the support experience
- Demonstrates investment in client success

**Application:** During stack building, to justify premium price

---

### 7. Application Close (High-Ticket)
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**For $7K+ Offers:**

**The Structure:**
1. Full value: "$23K for everything you get"
2. Reframe: "I'm gambling on you, not you on me"
3. Split offer: "$7K now, remaining $16K only if you make $100K"
4. Group photo of committed buyers
5. Filter: "Who's paying now vs who needs time?"

**Key Psychology:**
- Reverses risk ("I'm choosing you")
- Makes $7K feel small vs $23K
- Contingent payment reduces perceived risk
- Group photo = public commitment

**Source Quote:** "I'm gambling on you because I'm only going to make the back end if you're successful."

---

### 8. Bonus Session Re-Close
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Setup:**
Buyers-only session 30-60 minutes after close

**What Happens:**
- Go through objections in intimate setting
- Unbox physical gift (create Instagram moment)
- Reduce refunds through deeper connection
- Get fence-sitters to upgrade

**Results:**
- Myron's FHL re-close: Expected 60 more, got 200 more
- $3.85M in 30 minutes

**Why It Works:**
- Intimate setting lowers resistance
- Already bought = warmer audience
- Physical gift = reciprocity trigger
- FOMO from those who left

---

### 9. Myron Golden Close Psychology Principles
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**Key Principles:**

**Persuasion vs Convincing:**
- Persuasion: Help them decide for THEIR reasons
- Convincing: Push your reasons (creates resistance)

**Moral Obligation:**
"If product is good, must sell it. Not selling = withholding help."

**Positioning > Presentation:**
How they see you matters more than what you say

**Their Math:**
"$1M (goal) - $200K (what you made) = $800K cost of not knowing"

**Comparison Bigger Than Price:**
"$18K program vs $880K cost of not knowing over 10 years"

**Application:** Throughout close, especially objection handling

---

### 10. Choir Director Participation Close
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Technique:**
Get audience answering in unison throughout presentation

**Examples:**
- "Four things. How many things? FOUR!"
- "Does that make sense? Say YES!"
- "Are you ready? Say READY!"

**Why It Works:**
- Law of social proof (everyone's saying yes)
- Creates participation momentum
- Verbal commitment builds psychological buy-in
- Group energy influences individuals

**Application:** Throughout entire presentation, not just close

---

### 11. Tony Robbins Anchoring Strategy
**Tier:** 3 (Advanced)

**The Strategy:**
Tell stories during teaching that anchor mental states, then trigger at close

**Example Process:**

**During Teaching (30-60 minutes before close):**
1. Heart vs Mind exercise
2. "Heart is where dreams are. Mind keeps you safe."
3. Full exercise getting them to say: "I should follow my heart"
4. Multiple repetitions anchoring the response

**At Close:**
- Simply ask: "What is your heart telling you right now?"
- Already anchored: Follow heart = good
- They buy

**Why It Works:**
- Pre-frames decision as emotional, not logical
- Makes objections = "following mind" (bad)
- Makes buying = "following heart" (good)
- Anchor established before resistance builds

**Source Quote:** "This is the differentiator that separates the top 1% from everybody else."

2. Build DWY/DFY stack (Framework 1)
3. Use team videos for value (Framework 6)
4. Execute table rush (Framework 3)
5. Offer re-close session (Framework 8)

### For High-Ticket ($7K+):
1. Use application close (Framework 7)
2. Frame as "I'm choosing you" not "you're buying"
3. Show team videos (Framework 6)
4. Filter by who pays

### For Psychology Layer:
1. Anchor during teaching (Framework 11)
2. Use choir director throughout (Framework 10)

## Critical Reminders

1. **The close is the whole presentation** - Not just the pitch section
2. **Marinade bonuses early** - Build value when resistance is low
3. **DFY > DWY > DIY** - Stack from highest to lowest perceived value
4. **Table rush is just mechanics** - If you served them, they'll move
5. **Anchor during teaching, trigger at close** - This separates top 1%
6. **Re-close reduces refunds** - Intimate setting for objection handling
7. **Persuade, don't convince** - Help them decide for their reasons
8. **Show real team** - Videos demonstrate real cost = real value
