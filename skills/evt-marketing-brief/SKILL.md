## Tips for Health Practitioner Events

### Compliance Considerations
- Avoid implying medical consultations will occur at social events
- Focus on "schedule an appointment" rather than "get medical advice"
- Emphasize relationship-building over clinical services at events

### Effective Incentives for Health Practices
- Waived consultation fees (when scheduling follow-up)
- Discounted packages (buy X, get Y free)
- Low-cost diagnostic services (body scans, lab draws)
- Product bundles with gifts
- Grand prize giveaways (require contact info to enter)

### Messaging Best Practices
- Lead with the problem/pain point the audience experiences
- Emphasize trust, personalization, and being heard
- Address common objections proactively
- Use approachable, non-clinical language
- Create low-barrier entry points (drop-in, no appointment needed)

### Promotion Timeline Recommendations
- **4+ weeks out:** Announcement posts, early value messaging
- **2-3 weeks out:** Feature specific offers, address objections
- **Final week:** Countdown posts, urgency messaging
- **Day of:** Reminder and welcome posts
