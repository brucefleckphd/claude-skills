# The 8 Combination Frameworks

Michael Cage's 12 individual frameworks can be strategically combined into 8 powerful systems for specific situations and outcomes.

## Tier 1: Master Systems (Ace-Level)

### 1. Conversion Cascade
**Components:** Desire Tap + 4-Act Structure + Close Architecture

**When to use:**
- Building a sales-focused teleseminar from scratch
- Need maximum conversion efficiency
- Limited time to build (focus on essentials)
- Offer is straightforward (not complex)

**How it works:**
1. Identify the Desire Tap (what they already want)
2. Map the 4-Act Structure around moving them toward that desire
3. Design the Close Architecture to remove final obstacles and guide to action

**Why it's Tier 1:**
This is the minimum viable complete system. It strips away supporting frameworks to focus purely on conversion. Everything else (Hooks, Sticks, Stories, etc.) enhances this core, but this is the essential conversion engine.

**Output:** Complete conversion-optimized presentation (simplified)

**Build time:** 8-12 hours

**Example use case:**
You have a proven offer and need to create a webinar quickly. You don't need advanced engagement tactics—just a solid conversion engine.

### 2. Full-Funnel Presentation System
**Components:** All 12 frameworks integrated

**When to use:**
- Creating a signature presentation or course-level teleseminar
- High-ticket offer requiring world-class delivery
- Building a presentation you'll use repeatedly
- Competitive market requiring differentiation

**How it works:**
1. Complete Foundation Layer (Desire Tap + X-Ray)
2. Build Positioning Layer (Title + Authority)
3. Construct Architecture Layer (4-Act + all 6 supporting frameworks)
4. Design Conversion Layer (Objections + Close)

**Why it's Tier 1:**
This is the complete diagnostic and build system. Master level. When you need the absolute best presentation possible, you use all 12 frameworks. This is the "everything" approach.

**Output:** World-class presentation that converts at the highest level

**Build time:** 20-30 hours

**Example use case:**
You're launching a $5K coaching program and need a presentation that will be your primary sales vehicle for the next year. You need it to be exceptional in every dimension.

---

## Tier 2: Strategic Systems (King/Queen-Level)

### 3. Objection Burial Method
**Components:** Objection Anticipation + Story Arsenal + Chunk Architecture

**When to use:**
- Audience is highly skeptical or resistant
- Market is crowded with competitors
- Previous offers/launches failed due to objections
- Selling to burned/jaded audience

**How it works:**
1. List all objections using Objection Anticipation framework (aim for 20+)
2. Design Chunks that preemptively address each major objection
3. Select Stories that prove the objection is unfounded or can be overcome

**The pattern:**
- **Objection:** "This won't work for me because X"
- **Chunk:** Teaching point that addresses X
- **Story:** Proof that someone with X succeeded anyway

**Why it's Tier 2:**
Solves a specific strategic problem (high skepticism) through framework integration. Not a complete system (you still need Foundation, Positioning, Close), but a powerful strategic approach to the Architecture layer.

**Output:** Presentation that systematically removes all resistance

**Build time:** 5-8 hours (for Architecture layer)

**Example use case:**
You're selling a health supplement to an audience that's tried 10 other supplements and been disappointed. They're skeptical of everything. You need to preemptively handle every doubt.

**Detailed example:**

**Objection 1:** "Supplements don't work"
- **Chunk:** "Why 90% of Supplements Fail (And How to Identify the 10% That Don't)"
- **Story:** Case study of someone who tried 10 supplements before finding one that worked, with lab results proving efficacy

**Objection 2:** "This is too expensive"
- **Chunk:** "The Hidden Cost of Cheap Supplements (And Why Quality Saves Money)"
- **Story:** Person who spent $2K over 2 years on cheap supplements with zero results vs. $200 on quality with measurable results in 30 days

**Objection 3:** "I'll just get it from food"
- **Chunk:** "The Soil Depletion Problem (Why Food Alone Isn't Enough)"
- **Story:** Farmer explaining how modern soil has 70% fewer minerals than 50 years ago, with data

---

### 4. Tease Architecture
**Components:** Tease-Don't-Tell + 4-Act Structure + Close Architecture

**When to use:**
- High-ticket offers ($3K+) requiring sustained curiosity
- Complex systems that can't be fully taught in one presentation
- Selling depth/implementation over breadth
- When you need to differentiate free vs. paid value

**How it works:**
1. Map 4-Act Structure
2. Identify 5-7 strategic tease points throughout the presentation
3. Build Close that delivers on all teases (the complete system is in the program)

**The pattern:**
- Give the "what" (the framework/system)
- Give the "why" (rationale and importance)
- Tease the complete "how" (implementation details in the program)

**Why it's Tier 2:**
Strategic approach for specific offer type (high-ticket). Creates desire for depth and completeness without giving away the farm. Positions the program as essential, not optional.

**Output:** Presentation engineered to maintain curiosity and create desire for "the rest"

**Build time:** 10-15 hours

**Example use case:**
You're selling a $5K coaching program. If you teach the complete system in the webinar, there's no reason to buy. You need to create value while maintaining desire for more.

**Detailed example:**

**Act 1: Hook with the Promise**
"I'm going to show you the 3-step system for scaling to 7 figures—the same system I've used to build 5 companies and taught to 200+ entrepreneurs."

**Act 3: Tease Points Throughout**

**Chunk 1: "The 3-Step System Overview"**
- Teach: Here are the 3 steps (what)
- Teach: Why this sequence matters (why)
- Tease: "Each step has 5-7 sub-components. I'll touch on the key ones today, but the complete implementation playbook is 60+ pages and includes 30+ templates."

**Chunk 2: "Step 1: Foundation"**
- Teach: What Foundation means and why it's critical
- Teach: The #1 Foundation mistake people make
- Tease: "There are 7 Foundation elements. Today I'll cover the most important one. The complete Foundation Audit and Build System is in Module 1 of the program."

**Chunk 3: "Step 2: Scaling System"**
- Teach: The difference between growth and scaling
- Teach: The 3 scaling levers
- Tease: "Each lever has specific metrics and implementation protocols. The Scaling Playbook walks you through all 3 levers with exact metrics and timelines."

**Act 4: Close**
"So you now know the 3-step system. You understand WHAT to do and WHY. The question is HOW to implement this in your business, with your specific situation, and that's where the program comes in..."

**Result:** They feel they learned something valuable, but also recognize they need the complete system to actually implement.

### 5. X-Ray to Title Pipeline
**Components:** 8-Question X-Ray + Title Alchemy + Desire Tap

**When to use:**
- Starting from scratch with new audience or new offer
- Current positioning isn't resonating
- Entering a new market
- Testing new angles or offers

**How it works:**
1. Complete 8-Question X-Ray (deep audience research)
2. Identify Desire Tap from X-Ray answers (especially Q2: What do they REALLY want?)
3. Craft Title using Title Alchemy formulas based on X-Ray language (Q8)

**The pattern:**
- X-Ray reveals the language they use and deep desire
- Desire Tap identifies what to tap
- Title Alchemy creates the magnetic positioning using their language

**Why it's Tier 2:**
Solves the critical early-stage problem (positioning from research). Ensures your positioning is grounded in reality, not assumptions. This is how you create titles that make people say "That's exactly what I want!"

**Output:** Research-driven positioning that resonates deeply

**Build time:** 3-5 hours

**Example use case:**
You're launching a new offer and aren't sure how to position it. You need to ground your messaging in actual audience research.

**Detailed example:**

**Step 1: 8-Question X-Ray**

1. What do they want?
   - "Financial security in retirement"

2. What do they REALLY want?
   - "Freedom from worry about money"
   - "Ability to sleep at night without financial stress"
   - "Stop being terrified of market crashes"

3. What have they tried?
   - Buy-and-hold portfolios
   - Target-date funds
   - Financial advisor recommendations
   - Bonds

4. Why didn't it work?
   - Lost 30% in 2008, took 10 years to recover
   - Bonds don't provide enough income
   - Don't trust advisors after losses
   - Too complicated to manage

5. What do they believe?
   - "You have to accept risk to get returns"
   - "Market crashes are inevitable"
   - "I'm too old to recover from losses"

6. What do they doubt?
   - Any claim of "crash-proof" investing
   - Get-rich-quick schemes
   - Alternative investments

7. What do they fear?
   - Running out of money in retirement
   - Losing everything in a crash
   - Being a burden on their kids
   - Outliving their savings

8. What language do they use?
   - "Worry-free retirement"
   - "Sleep at night"
   - "Don't outlive my money"
   - "Safe income"
   - "Crash-proof"

**Step 2: Identify Desire Tap**
- Deep desire: Peace of mind and freedom from financial worry
- They don't want "high returns"—they want safety and security

**Step 3: Craft Title Using Title Alchemy**

**Formula: "How to [WANT] without [FEAR]"**

Using Q8 language + Q2 deep desire + Q7 fear:

**Title Options:**
1. "How to Build a Worry-Free Retirement Income (Even in Market Crashes)"
2. "How to Sleep at Night with Your Retirement Money (Without Gambling in the Stock Market)"
3. "How to Create Safe Retirement Income (Without Outliving Your Money)"

**Formula: "The [CONTRARIAN] to [OUTCOME]"**

Using Q5 belief + Q2 desire:

**Title Options:**
4. "The Crash-Proof Portfolio Strategy for Baby Boomers"
5. "The Anti-Risk Approach to Retirement Income"

**Select:** Option 1
- Uses their exact language ("worry-free," "market crashes")
- Addresses fear (crashes) and deep desire (peace of mind)
- Clear and specific

**Result:** Title grounded in real research, using audience language, tapping deep desire.

### 6. Attention Retention Matrix
**Components:** Hook Formulas + Stick Strategies + Chunk Architecture

**When to use:**
- Combating attention drop-off or low completion rates
- Presenting to distracted audiences (virtual events)
- Content is complex or potentially dry
- Need to improve engagement metrics

**How it works:**
1. Design Hook that grabs attention immediately (Act 1)
2. Place Stick Strategies at every transition point (prevent drop-off)
3. Structure Chunks to be short, punchy, and individually valuable (maintain momentum)

**The pattern:**
- **Hook:** Immediate attention grab (first 30 seconds)
- **Sticks:** Prevent leaving at transitions
- **Chunks:** Maintain engagement through valuable, digestible content

**Why it's Tier 2:**
Strategic approach to the attention/retention problem. In a world of infinite distraction, this combination keeps people watching. Optimizes for completion rate and engagement.

**Output:** Presentation engineered for maximum retention

**Build time:** 6-10 hours

**Metrics to track:**
- % who stay past 2 minutes (Hook effectiveness)
- % who complete Act 2 (Stick effectiveness)
- % who complete Act 3 (Chunk pacing and value)
- Average watch time
- Drop-off points (where people leave)

**Example use case:**
Your webinars have 40% drop-off in the first 10 minutes. You need to improve retention.

**Detailed example:**

**Hook (Shocking Stat + Contrarian):**
"Did you know that 73% of people who start webinars drop off before the first 10 minutes? Not because the content is bad, but because the OPENING is boring. I'm going to start differently. In the next 90 seconds, I'll give you the one insight that took me from $30K to $300K in revenue—and then we'll spend the next 40 minutes unpacking exactly how to apply it."

**Result:** Attention grabbed + promise of immediate value + commitment device ("I'll give you X in 90 seconds")

**Stick Strategy #1 (After Act 1):**
"Before we dive into the 5-step system, I need to warn you: Step 3 is counterintuitive. Most people resist it because it contradicts everything they've been told. But it's responsible for 80% of results. I'll reveal that in 15 minutes, but first you need to understand Steps 1 and 2..."

**Result:** Open loop created (what is Step 3?) + promise of high-value content coming

**Chunk Architecture (Short, Punchy, Individually Valuable):**

Instead of:
- 3 long chunks (15 min each = 45 min total)

Use:
- 7 short chunks (5-7 min each = 35-49 min total)

**Example:**
- Chunk 1: "The #1 Mistake" (5 min) - diagnostic
- Chunk 2: "The New Paradigm" (7 min) - reframe
- Chunk 3: "Step 1: Foundation" (6 min) - tactical
- Chunk 4: "Step 2: Build" (6 min) - tactical
- Chunk 5: "Step 3: The Counterintuitive Move" (7 min) - tactical
- Chunk 6: "Common Pitfalls" (5 min) - error prevention
- Chunk 7: "Putting It All Together" (5 min) - integration

**Why this works:**
- Each chunk is completable (small win every 5-7 minutes)
- Transitions are frequent (more opportunities for sticks)
- Each chunk delivers standalone value (even if they leave, they got something)

**Stick Strategy #2 (Midpoint):**
"We've covered Steps 1 and 2. You could implement just those and see 30-40% improvement. But the real breakthrough—the 3-5X results—comes from Steps 3-5. Especially Step 3, which I'm about to reveal..."

**Result:** Acknowledge value delivered so far + tease bigger value ahead

**Metrics:**
- Hook gets 90%+ past 2 minutes
- Stick #1 gets 75%+ past 10 minutes
- Short chunks maintain 60%+ to end
- Average watch time: 32+ minutes (vs. previous 18 minutes)

### 7. Proof Layering System
**Components:** Authority Architecture + Story Arsenal + Chunk Architecture

**When to use:**
- Building credibility with cold audiences
- Entering crowded/competitive markets
- Unknown speaker or new to market
- Audience is skeptical by nature (investors, engineers, etc.)

**How it works:**
1. Establish Authority Architecture early (why you)
2. Structure Chunks around proof points
3. Support each Chunk with a Story that demonstrates the proof

**The pattern:**
- **Authority:** Establishes you have the right to speak
- **Chunks:** Organized around provable claims
- **Stories:** Provide evidence for each claim

**Why it's Tier 2:**
Strategic approach to the credibility problem. Instead of just "claiming" expertise, you systematically prove it throughout the presentation. Each chunk builds on the previous to create comprehensive trust.

**Output:** Presentation that systematically builds trust and credibility

**Build time:** 8-12 hours

**Example use case:**
You're entering a market where you're unknown and competitors are established. You need to build credibility fast.

**Detailed example:**

**Authority Architecture (Act 1):**
"I've helped 500+ businesses scale to 7 figures over the last 8 years. My clients have collectively generated over $200M in revenue. I've also spent 3 years analyzing what separates the top 10% from everyone else—and I'm going to share that data with you today."

**Types of authority used:**
- Result authority (500+ businesses, $200M)
- Research authority (3 years analyzing data)
- Specificity (actual numbers)

**Chunk Architecture (Organized Around Proof Points):**

**Chunk 1: "The 3-Step Pricing Formula"**
- **Claim:** "Pricing wrong leaves 30-50% of revenue on the table"
- **Proof (Data):** "I analyzed 500 businesses. Those using this formula had 43% higher revenue on average than those pricing ad-hoc."
- **Proof (Story):** "Client X was charging $2K for a service. Competitors charged $3K-$5K for the same thing. We applied the formula, raised price to $4,500. Revenue doubled in 90 days because they attracted better clients AND sold more."
- **Application:** Here's the formula...

**Chunk 2: "The Offer Stack Method"**
- **Claim:** "Stacking offers increases conversions by 25-40%"
- **Proof (Data):** "Tested this across 200+ businesses. Average conversion increase: 31%."
- **Proof (Story):** "Client Y had a $1K offer. 5% conversion. We stacked it (core + 3 bonuses). Didn't change price. Conversion jumped to 7.2%. Revenue increased 44%."
- **Application:** Here's how to stack...

**Chunk 3: "The Urgency Equation"**
- **Claim:** "Real urgency (not fake scarcity) increases close rates by 50%+"
- **Proof (Data):** "A/B tested this on 50 launches. Real urgency beat no urgency by 52%."
- **Proof (Story):** "Client Z did a launch with no deadline. 12% close rate. Next launch, added cohort-based start date (real urgency). 19% close rate. Same offer, same audience."
- **Application:** Here's the equation...

**Proof Layering Across Presentation:**
- **Minute 2:** Authority (credibility established)
- **Minute 8:** Data proof (analyzed 500 businesses)
- **Minute 12:** Story proof (Client X transformation)
- **Minute 18:** Data proof (tested across 200 businesses)
- **Minute 23:** Story proof (Client Y transformation)
- **Minute 29:** Data proof (A/B tested on 50 launches)
- **Minute 35:** Story proof (Client Z transformation)

**Result:** By minute 35, they've heard:
- Your authority statement
- 3 data-backed claims
- 3 transformation stories
- Multiple proof types (data, stories, results)

**Trust systematically built through repeated proof.**

## Tier 3: Tactical Integration (Jack-Level)

### 8. Story-Chunk Integration Map
**Components:** Story Arsenal + Chunk Architecture + Tease-Don't-Tell

**When to use:**
- Transforming dry/technical teaching into engaging content
- Audience prefers narrative over data
- Content is complex and needs to be made accessible
- Want to create "edutainment" vs pure teaching

**How it works:**
1. Design Chunks (teaching points)
2. Select one Story per Chunk that makes the teaching memorable
3. Use Tease-Don't-Tell to create anticipation between stories

**The pattern:**
- **Chunk:** Teaching point
- **Story:** Makes it stick and provides proof
- **Tease:** Creates anticipation for next story

**Why it's Tier 3:**
Tactical solution for engagement without strategic complexity. Doesn't require all frameworks or solve a major strategic problem. But very effective for making content engaging.

**Output:** Story-driven content delivery that feels like entertainment, not teaching

**Build time:** 4-6 hours

**Example use case:**
You have great content but it's dry. People say "good information" but don't engage emotionally. You need to make it stick through story.

**Detailed example:**

**Chunk 1: "Why Most Marketing Fails"**
- **Teaching Point:** "Most marketing fails because it talks about features, not transformation"
- **Story:** "Meet Sarah. She was selling 'social media management services'—posting 5x/week, engagement tracking, monthly reports. Charged $500/month. Struggled to get clients. Then we reframed: 'I help local restaurants fill tables through Instagram.' Same service, different framing. She now charges $2K/month and has a waitlist. The lesson: people don't buy services, they buy outcomes."
- **Application:** "Look at your marketing. Are you selling services or outcomes?"
- **Tease:** "But reframing alone isn't enough. Sarah also changed ONE thing about her pricing, and that's when everything shifted. I'll show you what in Chunk 2."

**Chunk 2: "The ONE Thing That Changed Everything"**
- **Teaching Point:** "Pricing based on value, not hours"
- **Story:** "Sarah was charging hourly ($50/hour × 10 hours = $500/month). But the value to a restaurant filling 20 more tables per month at $50 profit per table = $1,000/month. She started pricing at 20% of value created: $200/month per 20 tables filled. Average client now pays $2K/month because she focuses on high-value restaurants. Same work, 4X revenue."
- **Application:** "Calculate the value you create, then price at 10-20% of that value."
- **Tease:** "Now Sarah had positioning and pricing. But she was still doing all the work herself. Then she discovered the Delegation Framework, which freed up 70% of her time while increasing revenue. That's Chunk 3."

**Chunk 3: "The Delegation Framework"**
- **Teaching Point:** "Delegate the $10/hour tasks, keep the $100/hour tasks"
- **Story:** "Sarah was doing posting, design, responding to comments—all $10-20/hour tasks. She hired a VA for $15/hour to handle those. She focused on sales calls, strategy, and client relationships—$100-200/hour tasks. Result: 15 hours/week instead of 40, but revenue increased because she sold more."
- **Application:** "List your tasks. Identify the $10/hour tasks. Delegate or eliminate them."
- **Tease:** "Delegation solved the time problem, but Sarah hit a new ceiling at $10K/month. Then she implemented the Scaling System, which took her from $10K to $30K in 4 months. Let me show you that system..."

**The Pattern:**
- Each chunk teaches one thing
- Each story is about the same person (Sarah) progressing
- Each tease creates anticipation for the next chapter
- The whole presentation becomes Sarah's transformation story with teaching embedded

**Why this works:**
- Story continuity (they want to know what happens to Sarah)
- Teaching is embedded in narrative (doesn't feel like a lecture)
- Teases create forward momentum (they want the next chapter)
- Relatable character (they see themselves in Sarah)

**Result:** Engagement stays high, content is memorable, teaching sticks because it's wrapped in story.
