- `process-volume-method.yml` - More ideas, not better ideas

### Core Frameworks (Tier 2)
- `process-bad-ideas-are-good.yml` - Don't drive with brakes on
- `process-daily-study-habit.yml` - Read promotions like vitamins
- `process-in-person-pitch-test.yml` - Watch their eyes before writing
- `process-feedback-loop.yml` - Write → Show → Watch → Revise
- `process-test-before-writing.yml` - Cheap tests save expensive failures
- `process-80-20-completion-rule.yml` - Ship at 95%, don't chase 100%
- `process-practice-method.yml` - eBay, ClickBank, real-world practice
- `process-write-to-improve.yml` - Daily writing muscle building

### Tactical (Tier 3)
- `process-copywriting-degree.yml` - Hero's Journey, screenwriting, trial law
- `process-non-native-advantage.yml` - Forced simplicity is advantage

## How to Use

1. **Identify the need** - What aspect of process needs improvement?
2. **Load relevant frameworks** - Read the frameworks that match your need from `references/`
3. **Apply the methodology** - Follow Deutsch's process and guidance
4. **Build the habit** - Most process frameworks require consistent practice
5. **Measure improvement** - Track results over weeks/months

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for a categorized list of all frameworks with one-line descriptions.

## Common Workflow Sequences

### Complete Skill Development Path
1. **Daily Study Habit** - Read one promotion daily (like vitamins)
2. **Practice Method** - Write with real stakes (eBay, ClickBank)
3. **Write to Improve** - Daily writing muscle building
4. **Copywriting Degree** - Study Hero's Journey, screenwriting, trial law

### Pre-Writing Validation Path
1. **In-Person Pitch Test** - Watch their eyes, test concept verbally
2. **Test Before Writing** - Cheap tests before full copy investment
3. **Feedback Loop** - Iterate based on real reactions

### Creative Output Path
1. **Volume Method** - Produce 100 ideas at 10% quality
2. **Bad Ideas Are Good** - Don't self-censor, let bad ideas lead to good
3. **Make It Better** - Polish top performers, seek critique
4. **80-20 Completion Rule** - Ship at 95%, don't chase perfection

### Improvement Cycle
1. **Make It Better** - Seek critique, not validation
2. **Feedback Loop** - Watch real reactions, not opinions
3. **Write to Improve** - Practice daily
4. **Daily Study Habit** - Absorb good patterns continuously

## Deutsch's Core Process Philosophy

### The Improvement Mindset
- Don't be precious about your words
- David Ogilvy: "Make this better" (not "Is this good?")
- Great copywriters love hearing what's wrong
- Outcome matters more than ego

### The Volume Principle
- Creative people don't have better ideas - they have MORE ideas
- 10% hit rate x 100 ideas = 10 good ideas
- 10% hit rate x 10 ideas = 1 good idea
- Quality emerges from quantity

### The Practice Imperative
- Write a little every day
- Writing muscle atrophies without use
- Read one great promotion daily (like vitamins)
- Practice with real stakes (eBay, ClickBank, real money)

### The Validation Before Investment
- Pitch in person, watch their eyes
- Test cheap before writing expensive
- Feedback loops beat isolation
- Know when 95% is good enough

## Related Skills

- `deutsch` - Full workflow orchestrator (for complete projects)
- `deutsch-strategy` - Strategic frameworks (Big Idea, 4 C's, Just Talk Method)
- `deutsch-headlines` - Headline frameworks (pairs with Volume Method)
- `deutsch-psychology` - Buyer psychology (understanding what to practice)

## Integration with Other Deutsch Components

This skill provides the **foundation** for executing all other Deutsch component skills:

- **Headlines:** Volume Method produces 100 headlines
- **Bullets:** Daily practice sharpens bullet writing
- **Leads:** In-Person Pitch Test validates lead angles
- **Body:** Feedback Loop improves energy and engagement
- **Stories:** Copywriting Degree (Hero's Journey) strengthens stories
- **Close:** Test Before Writing validates offers before full copy
- **Psychology:** Daily Study Habit absorbs psychological triggers
- **Strategy:** Make It Better philosophy drives Big Idea discovery

## Key Insights

### Why Volume Beats Precision
You can't predict which ideas will be breakthrough ideas. The only way to find them is to produce enough ideas that the great ones emerge naturally. 100 headlines at 10% quality beats 10 headlines at 50% quality.

### Why Daily Practice Matters
Neural pathways strengthen with daily use. Writing once a week requires constant re-learning. Writing daily builds unconscious competence - patterns become automatic.

### Why Testing Saves Money
One hour of in-person testing can save weeks of writing the wrong angle. $200 in cheap online tests can prevent $20,000 in wasted full copy production.

### Why Feedback Loops Accelerate Growth
Salespeople improve faster than copywriters because they see reactions constantly. Build feedback loops to get the same advantage - watch eyes, measure clicks, track responses.

### Why "Good Enough" Beats "Perfect"
First 20% of effort produces 80% of results. Spending 80% of effort chasing the last 20% of perfection is usually wasted. Two 95% promotions beat one 99% promotion.
