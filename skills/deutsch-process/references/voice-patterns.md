## THE DEUTSCH PROCESS VOICE

### Core Principle
Don't be precious. Great copywriters love hearing what's wrong. Just make it better.

### The Ogilvy Standard
"David Ogilvy would always give his copy to people. He would say, here, make this better. He didn't want to hear how good it was."

---

## THE VOLUME MINDSET

### Quantity Produces Quality
- Creative people don't have better ideas
- They have MORE ideas
- 10% hit rate × 100 ideas = 10 good ideas
- Never stop at 10 when you could do 100

### Bad Ideas Are Good
- Write down bad ideas
- They lead to good ideas
- Don't drive with the brakes on
- Edit later, flow now

---

## IMPROVEMENT PATTERNS

### The Feedback Loop
1. Write
2. Show people
3. Watch reactions
4. Revise
5. Repeat

"Salespeople get better because they're always getting feedback. They're always seeing the client get bored."

### The In-Person Pitch Test
Before writing:
- Pitch to people in person
- Watch their eyes
- If they glaze over, fix it
- Don't write until pitch works

"If you can't explain it to someone in an interesting way, you're not ready to write copy about it."

### The Daily Study Habit
- Read one successful promotion every day
- Like vitamins
- Gets good copy into your head
- Study structure, not just words

---

## GETTING UNSTUCK

### When Blocked
- Write bad ideas (they lead to good)
- Dictate into microphone (bypass writer brain)
- Talk to someone about it
- Switch to Just Talk mode

### When Perfectionist
- 80-20 rule: Know when good enough IS enough
- Don't chase last 5%
- Ship at 95%
- Better to write new promotion

### When No Ideas
- More research
- Talk to customers
- Deep dig with client
- Study swipe file

---

## PRACTICE METHODS

- Write bullets every day
- Even just journal
- Keep the muscle working

---

## TESTING VOICE

### Test Before Investing

- Cheap online tests
- Pitch in person first

"There's a lot of ways of testing on the internet now. Ways of testing things online before you do a landing page."

## THE NON-NATIVE ADVANTAGE

If English isn't your first language:
- Forced simplicity is an ADVANTAGE
- Complex writing is BAD copy anyway
- Caveman simple wins
- Your "limitation" is a feature

---

## VOICE CHECK QUESTIONS

### Before Writing
- "Do I understand the audience deeply enough?"
- "Can I pitch this in person interestingly?"
- "Have I done enough research?"

### While Writing
- "Am I flowing or editing too early?"
- "Am I talking or 'writing'?"
- "Would I say this across a table?"

### After Writing
- "Where did energy drop?" (Read aloud)
- "Is this 80% good enough?"
- "What would Ogilvy say to improve?"

---

## THE IMPROVEMENT LOOP

Every piece of copy follows:
1. **Flow** - Get it all out
2. **Structure** - Organize
3. **Energy Audit** - Find best paragraph
4. **Polish** - Bring all up to best level
5. **Simplify** - Caveman simple check
6. **Test** - Read aloud / pitch
7. **Revise** - Based on feedback
8. **Ship** - At 80-95% good enough

Then start next piece. Volume wins.
