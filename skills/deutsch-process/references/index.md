## Master Systems (Tier 1)

### The "Make It Better" Philosophy
- **File:** `process-make-it-better.yml`
- **Subcategory:** revision
- **Use when:** Any revision; receiving feedback; copy feels precious
- **Core principle:** Don't be precious. Great copywriters love hearing what's wrong. David Ogilvy: "Just make it better."
- **Pairs with:** process-volume-method, process-bad-ideas-are-good, process-feedback-loop

### The Volume Method
- **File:** `process-volume-method.yml`
- **Subcategory:** creative-output
- **Use when:** Not getting good results; output quality inconsistent
- **Core principle:** Creative people don't have MORE ideas, not better ideas. 10% hit rate x 100 ideas = 10 good ideas.
- **Pairs with:** process-bad-ideas-are-good, process-make-it-better, headlines-100-headlines-method

## Core Frameworks (Tier 2)

### The Bad Ideas Are Good Method
- **File:** `process-bad-ideas-are-good.yml`
- **Subcategory:** creative-flow
- **Use when:** Stuck; self-censoring; ideas not flowing
- **Core principle:** Write bad ideas. They lead to good ideas. Don't drive with the brakes on.
- **Pairs with:** process-volume-method, process-make-it-better, process-daily-study-habit

### The Daily Study Habit
- **File:** `process-daily-study-habit.yml`
- **Subcategory:** skill-development
- **Use when:** Improving as writer; want to absorb good copy patterns
- **Core principle:** Read one successful promotion every day. Like vitamins. Gets good copy into your head.
- **Pairs with:** process-practice-method, process-copywriting-degree, headlines-research-bookstore

### The In-Person Pitch Test
- **File:** `process-in-person-pitch-test.yml`
- **Subcategory:** validation
- **Use when:** Before writing; testing ideas; concepts feel unclear
- **Core principle:** Pitch to people in person. Watch their eyes. If they glaze over, fix it BEFORE writing.
- **Pairs with:** process-feedback-loop, process-test-before-writing, strategy-just-talk-method

### The Feedback Loop
- **File:** `process-feedback-loop.yml`
- **Subcategory:** improvement
- **Use when:** Want to improve; copy performance plateaued
- **Core principle:** Write → Show people → Watch reactions → Revise → Repeat. Salespeople improve because they see reactions constantly.
- **Pairs with:** process-in-person-pitch-test, process-make-it-better, process-test-before-writing

### The Test Before Writing
- **File:** `process-test-before-writing.yml`
- **Subcategory:** validation
- **Use when:** Before investing in copy; uncertain which angle will work
- **Core principle:** Test headlines, angles, and offers BEFORE writing full copy. Cheap tests save expensive failures.
- **Pairs with:** process-in-person-pitch-test, process-feedback-loop, headlines-testing-methodology

### The 80-20 Completion Rule
- **File:** `process-80-20-completion-rule.yml`
- **Subcategory:** productivity
- **Use when:** Perfectionism slowing you down; diminishing returns on polishing
- **Core principle:** Know when good enough is good enough. Don't spend hours on last 5%.
- **Pairs with:** process-volume-method, process-make-it-better, body-80-20-revision-rule

### The Practice Method
- **File:** `process-practice-method.yml`
- **Subcategory:** skill-development
- **Use when:** Getting started; building skills; don't have clients yet
- **Core principle:** Practice writing even without clients. eBay, ClickBank, your own stuff - find ways to write copy that matters.
- **Pairs with:** process-daily-study-habit, process-feedback-loop, process-copywriting-degree

### The Write to Improve Method
- **File:** `process-write-to-improve.yml`
- **Subcategory:** skill-development
- **Use when:** Daily practice; building writing muscle; maintaining skills between projects
- **Core principle:** Write a little every day. Headlines, body copy, guarantee copy, even journal. Keeps the muscle working.
- **Pairs with:** process-daily-study-habit, process-practice-method, process-volume-method

## Tactical (Tier 3)

### The Copywriting Degree
- **File:** `process-copywriting-degree.yml`
- **Subcategory:** education
- **Use when:** Learning the craft; want to deepen skills beyond copywriting books
- **Core principle:** Study adjacent fields - Hero's Journey, screenwriting, trial law. Great persuaders know story structure.
- **Pairs with:** stories-heros-journey-template, process-daily-study-habit, strategy-just-talk-method

### The Non-Native Advantage
- **File:** `process-non-native-advantage.yml`
- **Subcategory:** simplicity
- **Use when:** Feeling inadequate about English skills; copy too complex
- **Core principle:** Non-native speakers often write better because they're forced to be simple.
- **Pairs with:** body-caveman-simple-test, strategy-just-talk-method, process-practice-method

## Framework Categories

### By Subcategory:
- **Revision:** make-it-better
- **Creative Output:** volume-method
- **Creative Flow:** bad-ideas-are-good
- **Skill Development:** daily-study-habit, practice-method, write-to-improve
- **Validation:** in-person-pitch-test, test-before-writing
- **Improvement:** feedback-loop
- **Productivity:** 80-20-completion-rule
- **Education:** copywriting-degree
- **Simplicity:** non-native-advantage

### Workflow Sequences:

**Complete Skill Development Path:**
1. process-daily-study-habit (absorb patterns daily)
2. process-practice-method (practice with real stakes)
3. process-write-to-improve (daily writing muscle building)
4. process-copywriting-degree (deepen with adjacent fields)

**Pre-Writing Validation Path:**
1. process-in-person-pitch-test (test concept verbally)
2. process-test-before-writing (cheap tests before full copy)
3. process-feedback-loop (iterate based on reactions)

**Creative Output Path:**
1. process-volume-method (produce 100 ideas)
2. process-bad-ideas-are-good (don't self-censor)
3. process-make-it-better (polish top performers)
4. process-80-20-completion-rule (ship at 95%, don't chase 100%)

**Improvement Cycle:**
1. process-make-it-better (seek critique, not validation)
2. process-feedback-loop (watch real reactions)
3. process-write-to-improve (practice daily)
4. process-daily-study-habit (absorb good patterns)

## Deutsch's Core Process Philosophy

1. **Volume Over Precision:** More ideas at 10% quality beats fewer ideas at higher quality
2. **Make It Better, Not Perfect:** Ogilvy's mindset - always seeking improvement, never precious
3. **Daily Practice:** Writing muscle needs daily exercise like any other muscle
4. **Test Before Committing:** Cheap validation beats expensive failure
5. **Real Feedback Beats Theory:** Watch eyes, measure reactions, iterate based on data
