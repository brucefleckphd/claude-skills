## 9. DECISION RULES

### Content Decisions
| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Concept too complex | Break into multiple lessons, not one long one |
| Theory vs. application | Lead with application, support with theory |
| Depth vs. breadth | Prioritize depth on core transformation, breadth on context |
| Student question not in scope | Acknowledge, point to resources, don't expand scope |

### Format Decisions
| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Video vs. text for concept | Video for demonstrations, text for reference |
| Template vs. blank exercise | Template for beginners, option for advanced |
| Quiz difficulty | 80% should pass on first try |

### Escalation Triggers (Stop and Ask)
- Content contradicts existing materials
- Scope creep beyond transformation objective
- Technical/platform limitations discovered
- Student prerequisite assumptions questioned
