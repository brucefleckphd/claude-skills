## Document Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Project Name | [NAME] |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Created | [DATE] |
| Owner | [WHO OWNS DECISIONS] |
| Status | Draft / Active / Complete |

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE
*One sentence — what this produces. Be ruthlessly specific.*

**Primary Deliverable:**
[What exactly will exist when this is done?]

**Why This Matters:**
[The business/strategic reason — helps AI make judgment calls]

---

## 2. SUCCESS CRITERIA
*Measurable/verifiable outcomes — how we know it's done. Not vibes.*

### Must Have (Required for "Done")
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion]

### Should Have (Expected Quality Standard)
- [ ] [Quality criterion]
- [ ] [Quality criterion]

### Nice to Have (If Time/Resources Allow)
- [ ] [Bonus criterion]

---

## 3. DELIVERABLES
*Exact outputs with format specifications. No ambiguity.*

| Deliverable | Format | Length/Size | Location |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| [Item 1] | [MD/PDF/etc] | [Word count/pages] | [Where it goes] |
| [Item 2] | [Format] | [Size] | [Location] |

---

## 4. SCOPE

### In Scope (DO This)
- [Explicit inclusion]
- [Explicit inclusion]
- [Explicit inclusion]

### Out of Scope (DO NOT Do This)
- [Explicit exclusion]
- [Explicit exclusion]
- [Explicit exclusion]

### Adjacent But Separate (Note for Later)
- [Related item that's a different project]

---

## 5. CONSTRAINTS
*Boundaries, tone, length, what to avoid*

### Tone/Voice
- [Voice characteristics]
- [Reading level/audience sophistication]

### Format Constraints
- [Length limits]
- [Structure requirements]
- [Template adherence]

### Content Constraints
- [What to avoid mentioning]
- [Sensitive areas]
- [Brand/positioning requirements]

---

## 6. SOURCE MATERIALS
*What to reference, what has authority. Be explicit about hierarchy.*

### Primary Sources (Highest Authority)
| Source | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| [Document/resource] | [Path/URL] | [How to use it] |

### Secondary Sources (Reference Only)
| Source | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|

### Do NOT Use
- [Explicitly excluded sources]

---

## 7. DECISION RULES
*When encountering ambiguity, do X not Y. This is critical for autonomous execution.*

### If [SITUATION], Then [ACTION]
| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Unclear which direction to go | [Default choice] |
| Missing information | [Ask vs. assume vs. skip] |
| Conflicting source materials | [Which source wins] |
| Quality vs. speed tradeoff | [Which to prioritize] |
| Scope creep opportunity | [Include or defer] |

### Escalation Triggers (Stop and Ask)
- [Situation that requires human input]
- [Situation that requires human input]

---

## 8. APPROACH / METHODOLOGY
*How to execute. Optional but helpful for complex projects.*

### Phase 1: [Name]
- Step 1
- Step 2

### Phase 2: [Name]
- Step 1
- Step 2

---

## 9. DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Dependencies (Blocked Without These)
| Dependency | Status | Owner |
|------------|--------|-------|
| [What's needed] | [Ready/Pending] | [Who provides] |

### Risks (What Could Go Wrong)
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| [Risk] | H/M/L | [How to handle] |

---

## 10. TIMELINE / MILESTONES
*When things happen. Helps AI prioritize.*

| Milestone | Target Date | Deliverable |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| [Milestone] | [Date] | [What's delivered] |

---

## 11. COMPLETION STANDARD
*What "done" looks like — not "good enough." Be specific.*

### Definition of Done
This project is COMPLETE when:
1. [Specific completion criterion]
2. [Specific completion criterion]
3. [Specific completion criterion]

### Quality Gate
Before marking complete, verify:
- [ ] [Quality check]
- [ ] [Quality check]
- [ ] [Quality check]

### Handoff Requirements
- [Who receives the deliverable]
- [What format]
- [Any follow-up actions]

---

## 12. NOTES / CONTEXT
*Anything else the AI needs to know*

[Free-form context that helps execution]
