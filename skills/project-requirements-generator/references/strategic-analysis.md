## 8. DECISION RULES

### Research Decisions
| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Conflicting data | Note conflict, report both, assess credibility |
| Missing data | State gap, estimate if possible with assumptions |
| Overwhelming data | Prioritize recency and source quality |
| Rabbit hole opportunity | Note for future, stay on scope |

### Analysis Decisions
| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Correlation vs. causation | Default to correlation unless strong evidence |
| Multiple interpretations | Present top 2-3 with probability assessment |
| Uncertain conclusion | State uncertainty range, don't false-precision |

### Confidence Levels
| Level | Meaning | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| High | Very likely accurate | Multiple quality sources agree |
| Medium | Probably accurate | Limited sources or some conflict |
| Low | Uncertain | Single source or significant unknowns |
| Speculative | Informed guess | Logical extension with assumptions |

### Escalation Triggers (Stop and Ask)
- Finding contradicts core assumptions
- Scope needs expansion for useful answer
- Source access blocked
- Timeline at risk
