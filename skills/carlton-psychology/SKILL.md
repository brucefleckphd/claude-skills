# Carlton Psychology - Step 8 of the Simple Writing System

"Have a good product, but know that it won't sell itself."

## When to Use This Skill

- Understanding buyer psychology for copy
- Awakening prospects from zombie state
- Triggering A-Brain emotional buying
- Developing salesmanship mentality
- Overcoming sales resistance

## The Psychology Philosophy

### The Jungle Truth

> "We like to think we are different than the animals in the zoo. Some people say we're only a few steps away from the jungle - in reality, we've still got one foot in it."

> "We'd like to think it's an exalted sense of civilized behavior, but the only difference is we're better at deceiving other people that we're not a base animal wanting things."

People mask their primal desires with rational explanations. Your job is to tap both.

## The Zombie State

### The Problem

Your prospect is in a **dead, somnambulant blob state**. Carlton imagines them welded to the couch, like Jabba the Hutt.

They:
- Are distracted
- Don't want to hear from you
- View you as an interruption
- Are looking for reasons to leave

### The Goal

You have **seconds** to jolt them awake and bring them into your world.

> "You have to get him to move and get his wallet out. Giving money that was once his to someone else - one of the hardest human interactions to do."

### The Greased Slide

Once awakened, you must keep them sliding toward the sale. Every sentence must earn the next sentence.

## The One-Two Punch

### The Two Reasons People Buy

People always have **two separate sets of reasons** for buying almost anything:

**1. RATIONAL Reasons (the alibi):**
- To explain the purchase to spouse
- To justify to nosy neighbors
- To defend against arrogant brother-in-law
- To feel smart about the decision

**2. EMOTIONAL A-Brain Reasons (the real reasons):**
- That seal the deal deep inside
- Primal desires they may not admit
- Unconscious drives
- Gut-level wants

### How To Use This

You must satisfy BOTH:
- Provide rational proof and logic (the justification)
- Trigger emotional A-Brain desires (the motivation)

The emotional A-Brain makes the decision. The rational brain finds reasons to justify it.

## A-Brain Trigger Categories

### 1. GREED

The inherent desire for more/now/better/better-than-the-neighbor.

**Triggers:**
- Easy money
- Unfair advantage
- Insider info
- Getting rich
- Windfall
- Jackpot
- Shortcut to wealth
- Free money

**Carlton's observation:**
> "Good salesmen know that what you want to tap into is the inherent greed of the other person. They want more/now/better/better than the neighbor..."

### 2. FEAR

Avoidance of pain, loss, embarrassment.

**Triggers:**
- Being left out
- Missing opportunity
- Looking foolish
- Being scammed
- Losing money
- Public embarrassment

### 4. LUST/DESIRE

Beyond sexual - desire for any intense wanting.

**Triggers:**
- The irresistible

### 5. REVENGE/VINDICATION

The desire to prove doubters wrong.

## The Go-To Guy Mentality

### Don't Sell From Your Heels

**What it means:** Most people sell like this:
> "Here's what I've got. Do you want it? Nah, you probably don't."
> *...and they bolt out of there*

**Why this happens:**
- Most people don't like to sell
- Salesmen aren't held in high esteem
- Natural resistance to persuading others

**The fix:** Get straight on your goal. There is money out there that belongs to you.

### Be The Go-To Guy

The opposite of selling from your heels.

> "Say: 'I have what you need.'"

Position yourself as THE authority, THE expert, THE person they should buy from.

**Mindset:**
> "If you have a product or service that the person you're talking to needs or should have, then you should do everything you can to get that sales message across, because you're bettering their lives."

---

## Your Prospect's Psychology

### The Skeptical Prospect

No matter who you're writing for:
- He's skeptical
- He doesn't want to hear it
- You're probably an interruption
- He's looking for an out
- First thing he looks for is a reason NOT to read

### The First Challenge

> "In every ad, what you're saying is effectively: 'Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing that you have this problem, I'm...'"

Now what do you say after that to a stranger who:
- Doesn't know you
- Doesn't trust you
- Thinks you have a hidden agenda
- Will bolt the second he thinks you're crazy, boring, or trying to sell him

---

## Sales Resistance

### The Law of Reciprocity

There's natural resistance to doing what someone else tells you to do, even someone you like.

**The solution (from Claude Hopkins):**
- Offer SERVICE
- Give prospects something of value
- The law of reciprocity kicks in
- They become indebted to you

### Great Products Need Great Marketing

> "The marketing graveyard is crammed with great products that died because nobody knew how to sell them."

A good product alone is not enough. You must have the salesmanship to get the message across.

## David Garfinkel's Reasons People Buy

A useful framework for matching your copy to buyer motivation:

1. **To make money**
2. **To save money**
3. **To save time**
4. **To save effort**
5. **To reduce pain**
6. **To increase health**
7. **To increase pleasure**

**How to use:** Don't literally write "Increase Your Pleasure!" - apply it to a specific situation:
> "Feel like you're getting a foot massage with a masseuse that has hands like silk."

---

## The Sophistication Trap

### The Business Owner's Mistake

Many businesspeople start exalting their prospect/customer base:
> "My customers are different."
> "They won't read long copy."
> "They won't respond to those kinds of things."

### Carlton's Reality

> "No one's ever gone broke underestimating the intelligence/greed of the American people."

People will **mask** their greed. You have to see through that veneer.

**Example:**
> "People go to charity balls not because they're aching to give money to starving African children, they're there to be seen, to dress up, to do things."

## Mandatory Workflow

### Step 1: Identify A-Brain Triggers
For your specific market and offer:
- [ ] Which greed triggers apply?
- [ ] Which fear triggers apply?
- [ ] Which ego/pride triggers apply?
- [ ] Which other triggers apply?

### Step 2: Map the One-Two Punch
- [ ] What are the RATIONAL reasons they'll use to justify?
- [ ] What are the EMOTIONAL reasons that will actually drive the decision?
- [ ] How will you address both?

### Step 3: Zombie State Plan
- [ ] What will jolt them awake?
- [ ] What's the greased slide?
- [ ] How will you keep them engaged?

### Step 4: Resistance Check
- [ ] What service/value are you offering first?
- [ ] How are you overcoming skepticism?
- [ ] Where might they bolt?

### Step 5: Go-To Guy Positioning
- [ ] Are you selling from front foot or heels?
- [ ] Is your authority established?
- [ ] Do you have what they need?
