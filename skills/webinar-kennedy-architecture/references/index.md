# Kennedy Architecture Frameworks - Quick Reference

## 12 Frameworks by Tier

### Tier 1: Foundation (3)
1. **Universal Group Presentation Structure** - Open/Middle/Bridge/Close works everywhere
2. **Media-Agnostic Architecture** - Execution changes, structure doesn't
3. **Three-Act Minimum Structure** - Setup/Build/Close required

### Tier 2: Strategic (3)
4. **Time Frame Allocation Formula** - How to divide time by media
5. **Physical vs. Distance Handicaps** - Compensating for lack of presence
6. **Checkout Prevention System** - Stop them leaving early

### Tier 3: Advanced (3)
7. **Multi-Segment Architecture** - Series of complete mini-presentations
8. **Bookend Principle** - Primacy/recency memory pattern
9. **Sequential Time Boxes** - Fill boxes, don't write till done

### Tier 4: Mastery (3)
10. **Evergreen vs. Timely Relevance** - Core stays, hooks change
11. **Assumed Knowledge Trap** - Never assume anything established
12. **Pre-Presentation Establishment** - Control what they know before you present

## Core Kennedy Truths

1. Structure is universal across all media
2. Prevention (stopping checkout) > conversion
3. Time is finite (unlike sales letters)
4. Never assume knowledge - re-establish every time
5. Distance has unique handicaps requiring compensation
