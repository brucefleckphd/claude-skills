# Evaldo Headlines

Evaldo Albuquerque's headline frameworks. Headlines are the single most important element of any copy - they determine whether anyone reads the rest. Evaldo's approach centers on creating "open loops" that the brain MUST close.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing headlines for any medium
- Headline isn't getting clicks/reads
- Testing headline variations
- Learning headline psychology
- Critiquing headline effectiveness

## Crown Jewels

1. **The 13 Headline Boosters** - Universal elements that amplify any headline
2. **The Open Loop Principle** - Why brains can't resist incomplete patterns
3. **The Curiosity-Benefit Stack** - Combining intrigue with promise
4. **The News Angle Pattern** - Leveraging timeliness for attention
