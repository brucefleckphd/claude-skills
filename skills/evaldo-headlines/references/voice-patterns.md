# Evaldo Voice Patterns - Headlines

## Headlines-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing headlines.

---

## THE EVALDO HEADLINE VOICE

### Core Principle
Headlines are open loops, not complete statements. Create tension that demands resolution.

### The Open Loop Sound
- Something unfinished
- A question implied
- A mystery hinted
- Resolution only inside

---

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS

### Curiosity Starters

**Strong (Open Loops):**
- "The strange..."
- "The weird thing about..."
- "What nobody tells you about..."
- "The hidden..."
- "Why [unexpected thing]..."

**Weak (Closed or Generic):**
- "A great way to..."
- "The best..."
- "Amazing..."
- "How to easily..."

### Specificity Language

**Strong (Specific):**
- "The 7-minute..." (odd number)
- "$4,217 per month" (non-round)
- "By March 15th" (specific date)
- "In 21 days" (exact timeframe)

**Weak (Vague):**
- "Quickly..."
- "A lot of money..."
- "Soon..."
- "Many people..."

### Violation Language

**Strong (Pattern Interrupt):**
- "Why [common belief] is wrong"
- "The truth about..."
- "What [authority] won't tell you"
- "[Thing] is actually [opposite]"

**Weak (Expected):**
- "[Thing] is good for you"
- "The importance of..."
- "Why you should..."

## HEADLINE RHYTHM

### The Evaldo Cadence
- Short, punchy phrases
- One clear idea per headline
- Front-load the hook
- End with forward momentum

### Examples of Rhythm:

**Good:**
> "The 3am trick that melts belly fat"
(Hook → Curiosity → Benefit)

**Good:**
> "Why the IRS doesn't want you to see this"
(Violation → Authority → Open loop)

**Weak:**
> "Learn about a really good new way to possibly lose weight"
(Too long → Too vague → No hook)

## CHECKLIST BEFORE USING ANY HEADLINE

Ask yourself:
1. Is there an open loop? (Can they close it without reading?)
2. Is it specific? (Numbers, timeframes, names?)
3. Does it pass Croc Brain? (Lion/Rabbit + Simple + New?)
4. Would I stop scrolling for this?
5. Is the benefit clear?
