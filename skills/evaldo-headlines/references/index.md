## The Most Important Truth

**Every headline must create an OPEN LOOP.**

An open loop is an unfinished pattern the brain is desperate to close. If they can satisfy their curiosity WITHOUT clicking, you've lost.

The Zeigarnik Effect: Interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones. Use this - start something in the headline that can only be finished by reading.

## Quick Filter

Before using ANY headline, ask:
1. Does it pass Croc Brain? (Lion/Rabbit + Geico + Curiosity)
2. Does it create an open loop?
3. Does it promise something specific?
4. Would I stop scrolling for this?
