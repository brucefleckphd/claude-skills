## Sound Pattern Guidelines

### Phonetic Power Rankings

**Strong Sounds (Use These):**
- Hard consonants: K, P, T, B, D, G
- Explosive starts: "Blast," "Power," "Kick"
- Short, punchy syllables

**Weak Sounds (Avoid):**
- Soft, mumbled sounds
- Too many syllables (3+ gets hard)
- Awkward letter combinations

### Rhythm Rules

- 2-3 syllables ideal
- Strong stress on first syllable
- Ends cleanly (no trailing sounds)

**Good:** "Fat Flush" (2 syllables, hard F, clean ending)
**Bad:** "Metabolization Enhancement" (too long, weak ending)
