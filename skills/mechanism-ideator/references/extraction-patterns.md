## Mechanism Potential Scoring

Rate each candidate 1-5:

| Criteria | Question | Score |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Novelty** | Would target market be surprised? | /5 |
| **Nameability** | Can we give it a proprietary name? | /5 |
| **Provability** | Is there evidence in the content? | /5 |
| **Market Fit** | Does it solve their real problem? | /5 |
| **Ownership** | Can they uniquely claim this? | /5 |

**Scoring:**
- **20-25** - Strong candidate, develop immediately
- **15-19** - Good candidate, needs clarification
- **10-14** - Weak candidate, probably skip
- **<10** - Not a mechanism, reject

## Red Flags (Skip These)

- ❌ No clear blame-shift
- ❌ Sounds like a concept name, not a discovery
- ❌ Generic or vague naming
- ❌ No evidence in the content
- ❌ Already widely known in the market
- ❌ Doesn't fit the market domain
- ❌ Too complex to explain in 1-2 sentences
