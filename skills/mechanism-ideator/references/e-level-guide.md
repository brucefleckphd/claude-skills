## The Five E-Levels

### E1: Basic Mechanism
**Sophistication:** Entry-level
**Market Stage:** 1-2 (Unaware to Problem-Aware)

**Characteristics:**
- Simple naming of the problem/solution
- Single-component mechanism
- Direct cause-effect relationship
- No visual metaphor required

**Example:** "Vitamin D deficiency causes fatigue"

**Score Range:** 50-70

---

### E2: Enhanced Mechanism
**Sophistication:** Intermediate
**Market Stage:** 2-3 (Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware)

**Characteristics:**
- Named mechanism + simple visual
- Basic villain identification
- Some scientific backing
- Elementary visual metaphor

**Example:** "Leaky gut - toxins flooding through holes in your intestinal wall"

**Score Range:** 70-85

---

### E3: Multi-Component Mechanism
**Sophistication:** Advanced
**Market Stage:** 3-4 (Solution-Aware to Product-Aware)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple interconnected components
- Complete UMP/UMS/UMD structure
- Extended visual metaphor system
- Strong proof integration

**Example:** "The Lectin Shield Protocol - 3-phase system addressing lectins, gut healing, and microbiome restoration"

**Score Range:** 85-100

---

### E4: Paradigm-Shifting Mechanism
**Sophistication:** Expert
**Market Stage:** 4 (Product-Aware, Skeptical)

**Characteristics:**
- Contradicts conventional wisdom
- Creates new category understanding
- Deep scientific credibility
- Comprehensive villain story
- Shifts blame completely

**Example:** "The Obesity Code - Insulin, not calories, controls fat storage"

**Score Range:** 100-115

---

### E5: Meta-Mechanism
**Sophistication:** Elite
**Market Stage:** 5 (Most Skeptical)

**Characteristics:**
- Enemy of enemies
- Explains why all other mechanisms fail
- System-level understanding
- Complete paradigm replacement
- Undeniable proof stack

**Example:** "The root cause of ALL health problems is mitochondrial dysfunction - addressing individual symptoms is futile"

**Score Range:** 115-130

## Market Sophistication Mapping

| E-Level | Market Stage | Headline Formula |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| E1 | Stage 1-2 | "[Product] does [thing]" |
| E2 | Stage 2-3 | "New [mechanism] fixes [problem]" |
| E3 | Stage 3-4 | "The [specific mechanism] that [unique benefit]" |
| E4 | Stage 4 | "Why [common belief] is wrong and [new mechanism]" |
| E5 | Stage 5 | "The hidden [meta-mechanism] behind every [category]" |

## Calibration Rules

1. **Never over-sophisticate** - E5 mechanism for E1 market confuses
2. **Never under-sophisticate** - E1 mechanism for E5 market bores
3. **Match awareness level** - Meet them where they are
4. **Ladder up if needed** - Can educate through copy
