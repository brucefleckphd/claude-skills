## How This Works (8-Phase Process)

This skill runs an 8-phase process:

1. **Phase 0: Market Context** - Establish who you're selling to and what they believe
2. **Phase 1: Content Ingestion** - Deep-read all program files looking for hidden root causes
3. **Phase 2: Mechanism Mining** - Extract candidates, run 5 quality tests, cut failures
4. **Phase 3: Research Sprint** - Launch web-search agents in parallel to find academic backing, case studies, statistics, visual metaphors
5. **Phase 4: Development** - Build full UMP/UMS/UMD structure with research integrated
6. **Phase 5: Layering** - Determine how mechanisms work together in sales copy
7. **Phase 6: Scoring** - Run 13-dimension V3 Scorecard evaluation on each mechanism
8. **Phase 7: Output** - Create folder structure with all deliverables

## Critical Distinctions (Read Before Doing Anything)

### A Mechanism Is NOT:

| What It's NOT | What It IS |
|---------------|------------|
| A concept name ("The Translation Gap") | A hidden root cause that explains WHY they failed |
| A framework label ("The Four Shifts") | A specific, discoverable THING that was blocking them |
| A teaching idea renamed ("The Rescue Trap") | Something that sounds DISCOVERED, not invented |
| A clever metaphor ("Cognitive Calcium") | Something that fits the MARKET DOMAIN of the product |
| A generic description of the problem | A specific enemy or phenomenon they didn't know about |

### The Five Mechanism Tests

A mechanism MUST pass ALL of these. Any failure = cut or rework.

1. **The Sales Letter Test:** Write "It's not [what they think]. It's [MECHANISM] - [1-sentence explanation]." Does it sound like a revelation?
2. **The Domain Test:** Does it sound like it belongs in copy for THIS market? (Business = organizational/methodological. Health = biological/scientific. Finance = economic/structural.)
3. **The Blame Shift Test:** Does it completely shift blame from the prospect to something external they didn't know about?
4. **The Demand Test:** Does naming this mechanism create demand for YOUR specific solution?
5. **The Discovery Test:** Does it sound like something DISCOVERED or REVEALED - not just cleverly named?

### Anti-Patterns (Mistakes That Produce Bad Mechanisms)

1. **Concept Naming** - Renaming a teaching concept and calling it a mechanism. Ask: "Is this something they already KNOW from the content, or something they DON'T KNOW?"
2. **Domain Mismatch** - Using health/medical language for non-health products. Ask: "Would this phrase appear naturally in a sales letter for THIS product?"
3. **Clever-But-Empty Naming** - Catchy names that don't name a real root cause. Ask: "Does this name a THING that exists, or just describe a behavior?"
4. **Borrowed Concepts** - Someone else's named concept presented as yours. Ask: "Did we discover this, or are we borrowing it?"
5. **Abstraction Without Specificity** - Vague names that could mean many things. Ask: "Can the prospect point to this thing in their own experience?"
6. **Lists Instead of Mechanisms** - 20 name options instead of 3-5 developed mechanisms. If generating more than 5 names without writing copy sentences, you're name-storming, not mechanism-building.

## Phase 0: Market Context (REQUIRED - Do This First)

Before reading ANY content, establish:

### 1. Market Domain
What market is this product in? This determines mechanism language.

| Market | Mechanism Language Should Sound... | Examples |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Health/Supplements | Biological, scientific, clinical | "Leptin Resistance," "Gut Permeability" |
| Business/Marketing | Organizational, methodological, structural | "The Innovator's Dilemma," "Technical Debt" |
| AI/Technology | Paradigmatic, operational, systemic | "Pre-AI Operating System," "Paradigm Lock" |
| Internet Marketing / Entrepreneurial | Strategic, identity-shifting, opportunity-based, urgent | "The Strategic Entrepreneur," competitive advantage framing |
| Finance | Economic, structural, mathematical | "Options Decay," "The Invisible Tax" |
| Self-Improvement | Psychological, behavioral, identity-based | "Fixed Mindset," "Learned Helplessness" |

**RULE: Never use health/medical mechanism language for a non-health product.**

**RULE: For entrepreneurial/IM markets, mechanisms must account for:**
- Speed/urgency - the market is moving fast
- Confusion about the path - prospects are problem-aware but solution-confused
- Identity - this market responds to identity-level mechanisms
- FOMO/acceleration - the world is speeding up
- What they've already tried - courses, coaching, tools, self-learning, hiring

### 2. What the prospect believes the problem is
Go deeper than surface belief. In sophisticated markets, prospects may be:
- Problem-aware but solution-confused
- Overwhelmed by options
- Afraid of falling behind
- Skeptical of training (they've bought courses before)

### 3. What they've tried that hasn't worked
Be exhaustive: courses, coaching, self-learning, hiring, consultants, tools, subscriptions, masterminds, YouTube, etc.

### 4. Villain Archetype Selection
Choose the primary villain BEFORE mining content:

| Archetype | Best When... |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hidden Enemy** | Something they don't know exists |
| **Betrayer** | Something they trust is actually hurting them |
| **Blocker** | Something preventing success |
| **Saboteur** | Active undermining |
| **Conspiracy** | System designed against them |
| **Deficiency** | Missing critical element |
| **Outdated System** | Approach worked before but doesn't now |
| **Environmental Mismatch** | World changed but they didn't |
| **Silent Accumulator** | Building up unnoticed |
| **Invisible Tax** | Hidden ongoing cost |

> See `references/villain-frameworks.md` for 7 attack patterns, origin story templates, and naming guidelines.

**NOTE:** Villains can be LAYERED. Primary + secondary. In fast-moving markets, the time dimension is often critical.

### 5. Mechanism Approach Classification

| Type | Use When... |
|------|------------|
| **Scientific Discovery** | Research/data reveals hidden cause |
| **Paradigm Shift** | Everything they know is wrong |
| **Hidden Enemy** | Unknown villain revealed |
| **Missing Link** | One thing was missing all along |
| **Insider Knowledge** | Expert reveals what others won't |
| **Environmental Shift** | World changed and old playbook expired |

---

## Phase 1: Content Ingestion

Read ALL provided program files. Look for:

**Hidden Root Causes**
- What underlying THING is causing their failure?
- What specific, nameable phenomenon is blocking results?
- What do they NOT KNOW that explains why they're stuck?

**Blame-Shift Opportunities**
- What can absorb blame that ISN'T the prospect?
- What external factor, system, or condition is responsible?

**Paradigm Violations**
- What do they believe that's no longer true?
- What assumption are they operating under that expired?

**Academic/Historical Backing Opportunities**
ACTIVELY LOOK FOR:
- Named researchers associated with this phenomenon
- Historical parallels where the same pattern played out
- Documented studies or statistics
- Named phenomena from other fields that apply

**The best mechanisms have:** A named researcher OR a documented historical parallel OR published research.

---

## Phase 2: Mechanism Mining

For each potential mechanism, run the FIVE TESTS:

| Test | Question | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Sales Letter Test** | "It's not [X]. It's [MECHANISM]." Sounds like a revelation? | |
| **Domain Test** | Belongs in copy for THIS market? | |
| **Blame Shift Test** | Shifts blame completely off the prospect? | |
| **Demand Test** | Creates demand for this specific solution? | |
| **Discovery Test** | Sounds discovered, not invented? | |

**Any mechanism that fails even ONE test gets cut or reworked.**

Then evaluate survivors:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Novelty** | Unknown to the target market? |
| **Specificity** | A specific, nameable thing? |
| **Provability** | Evidence in the content? |
| **Market Fit** | Matches villain archetype and approach? |
| **Ownership** | Can we claim this uniquely? |
| **Copy Integration** | Explained in 1-2 sentences? |

---

## Phase 3: Research Sprint (REQUIRED)

**Do NOT skip this phase.** Before developing mechanisms, run comprehensive research to gather proof.

### Step 1: Launch 5-7 Research Agents in Parallel

**Agent 1: Academic Foundations**
Search for: Named researchers, academic papers, historical parallels, key citations related to each mechanism concept. Verify dates and attributions. Flag common misconceptions.

**Agent 2: Modern Case Studies**
Search for: 3-5 case studies per mechanism with SPECIFIC numbers (revenue, employees, growth rate, timelines). Organize by: Failures (prove the problem), Successes (prove the solution), Reversals (tried and learned). Include "Sales Copy Angle" for each.

**Agent 3: Visual Metaphor Development**
Create: 3 visual metaphor options per mechanism. Each includes: Image, Copy Angle, Why It Works, Domain Fit assessment. Rank by effectiveness. No medical metaphors for non-health products. No clichés.

**Agent 4: Statistics & Proof Points**
Search for: At least 5 statistics per mechanism with: Value, Source, Year. Flag unsourced stats as [UNVERIFIED]. Include percentages, comparisons, timeline data, current state data.

**Agent 5: Adoption/Timeline Data** (if mechanisms involve urgency/windows)
Search for: Adoption rates, historical timelines, window duration estimates, leader vs. laggard gaps.

**Agent 6-7: Topic-Specific** (adapt to mechanism content)
Example: For complexity-related mechanisms, search complexity economics. For identity-related mechanisms, search expert's curse / paradigm blindness psychology.

### After Agents Return

Create a `Research-Package.md` for each mechanism containing:
- Academic citations (corrected and verified)
- Case studies with numbers
- Statistical proof table
- Visual metaphor recommendation

Also create a `/Research/` folder with cross-mechanism files:
- `Academic-Foundations.md`
- `Modern-Case-Studies.md`
- `Visual-Metaphors.md`
- `Statistics.md`

## Phase 4: Mechanism Development (With Research)

For top 3-5 mechanisms that passed all tests:

```markdown
## Mechanism #X: [Name]

### The Five Tests
| Test | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Sales Letter | PASS | "It's not [X]. It's [NAME] - [explanation]" |
| Domain Match | PASS | [Why this fits the market] |
| Blame Shift | PASS | [What absorbs blame] |
| Demand Creation | PASS | [Why this demands our solution] |
| Discovery Feel | PASS | [Why this sounds discovered] |

### The Hidden Root Cause
[The specific thing blocking them - named concretely]

### Why They Don't Know About It
[Why this stayed hidden]

### How It Blocks Them
[The specific mechanism of harm/failure]

### Villain Archetype Used: [Which one]

### The Blame Shift
[It's not your fault because...]

### The Solution Logic
[Only THIS approach addresses the root cause because...]

### Copy Integration Draft

**Hook Mechanism (simplified):**
"[2-5 word teaser version]"

**Full Mechanism (for body copy):**
"[1-2 sentence full explanation]"

**Sales Letter Sentence:**

## Phase 5: Mechanism Layering Strategy

Mechanisms don't compete - they LAYER.

| Position | Role | What It Does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Lead** | "Oh shit" recognition | Most visual/concrete mechanism |
| **Diagnosis** | Personal explanation | Why THEY specifically are affected |
| **Stakes** | Urgency | What happens if they don't act |
| **Explanation** | Why nothing worked | Why courses/tools haven't helped |
| **Opportunity** | Paradigm shift | What's now possible |

Document which mechanism fills each position.

---

## Phase 6: Full Evaluation

Use the scoring rubrics in `references/evaluator-rubrics.md` to score each mechanism on all 13 dimensions.

**Scoring Thresholds:**
| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 0-49 | Weak - needs complete rework |
| 50-69 | Below Average - major improvements needed |
| 70-89 | Average - competitive but not dominant |
| 90-109 | Strong - competitive, likely to win |
| 110-119 | Excellent - domination potential |
| 120-130 | Elite - category-defining |

Create an `Evaluation.md` for each mechanism with:
- Full 13-dimension scorecard with evidence
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 weaknesses with specific fixes
- Remaining research gaps

---

## Phase 7: Output Structure

Create this folder structure:

```
[Program Name]/00 Mechanism Work/
├── 00 Summary.md (rankings, key stats, research status)
├── 00 Process Documentation.md (how this was created)
├── Mechanisms.md (master doc - all mechanisms, copy-ready)
├── Research/
│   ├── Academic-Foundations.md
│   ├── Modern-Case-Studies.md
│   ├── Visual-Metaphors.md
│   └── Statistics.md
├── 01 [Mechanism Name]/

│   └── Research-Package.md (synthesized research)
├── 02 [Mechanism Name]/
│   ├── Evaluation.md
│   └── Research-Package.md
... etc
```
