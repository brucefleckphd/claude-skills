## USAGE NOTES

### When Writing Headlines
Use BETRAYAL and SURPRISE words most heavily. Clayton's strongest headlines activate these two emotions.

### When Writing Leads
Start with FEAR or IDENTIFICATION (frustration, powerlessness). The reader must feel SEEN before they'll trust you.

### When Writing Body Copy
Weave through the emotional sequence. Use COLLOQUIAL expressions to maintain energy. Vary rhythm.

### When Writing Closes
Heavy on URGENCY and SECURITY. The reader must feel both "I need to act NOW" and "It's safe to act."

### When Writing Proof Sections
Load with SECURITY words. Stack credibility. Use specific numbers. Quote testimonials with PASSION words.
