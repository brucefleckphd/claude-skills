## Kennedy's Core Content Principles

1. **Middle's #1 Job:** Make not buying feel like disappointment
2. **7-21 Repetition Rule:** Key ideas must be repeated 7-21 times in different ways
3. **Tell WHAT, Never HOW:** Tell what to do and what NOT to do, but never how to do it
4. **Handle Every Objection:** Can't adjust like one-to-one, must address everything upfront
5. **E-Factors Drive Purchasing:** Emotion drives, logic supports

## Key Kennedy Quotes

> "The more invested in buying a person is, the more likely they are to buy because not buying is now disappointing, frustrating, and failure."

> "The 7 to 21 times repetition. If you move into a new house, then depending upon how quick a study you are, but at least for seven nights, like an idiot, you will be in the dark reaching for the light switches where they were in the old house."

> "They only need to know enough to buy. You gain no leverage by giving them any more knowledge than what they need to buy."

> "The more demonstration you do, the better that you will do."

> "From a playing fair standpoint, you do no one any favors by just burying their butt in information. They won't go use it anyway. They can't."

## Common Middle Mistakes

1. **Too Complicated** - Teachers teach too much, overwhelm audience
2. **Lost Connections** - Don't hook ideas together, assume they're following
3. **Too Much Information, Not Enough Emotion** - Logic heavy, emotion light
4. **No Fun** - Too serious, no entertainment or humor
5. **Raising Doubt** - Technical complexity creates uncertainty instead of confidence

## Structure of Promises

### Primary Promise
The one big thing - make it as big and bold as you can fulfill.

### Secondary Promises (Three Types)
1. **Actual benefits:** What they tangibly get
2. **How they feel:** Emotional state from having it
3. **How others feel about them:** Social/status benefits

### The Wheel Method
Primary in center, secondaries on spokes: Money, Love/Sex, Family, Health, Security, Status, Lifestyle

### Stacked Promises
When time-tight, combine 2-3 promises in one statement.

## Bookending and Primacy/Recency

**Law:** People remember first things and last things, almost nothing from middle.

**Solution:** Bookend everything - state key idea, supporting content, restate key idea.

**Summary Statements:** In longer presentations, stop periodically to summarize what's been covered before moving to next section.
