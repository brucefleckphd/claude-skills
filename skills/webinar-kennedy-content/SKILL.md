# Kennedy Content Frameworks

Dan Kennedy's comprehensive system for the Middle of group presentations—where commitment forms, emotions attach, and objections are overcome. The Middle's primary job: Make not buying feel like disappointment.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building the teaching/content section of presentations
- Creating emotional investment in your offer
- Handling objections before the close
- Using proof effectively across multiple modalities
- Maintaining interest over extended presentations
- Structuring promises (primary and secondary)
- Applying E-Factors to drive purchasing decisions

**Critical:** The Middle is NOT about delivering maximum information. It's about creating maximum commitment through emotional attachment and sequential agreement.

## Core Philosophy

> "The more invested in buying a person is, the more likely they are to buy because not buying is now disappointing, frustrating, and failure."

Kennedy's Middle is about investment—time invested, ideas accepted sequentially, emotional attachment formed. When someone has invested heavily, NOT buying becomes the painful option.

## Frameworks Included (31)

Organized by function:

**4.1 Middle Purposes (7 frameworks)** - What the Middle must accomplish
**4.2 E-Factors (10 frameworks)** - The emotional drivers of all purchasing
**4.3 Commitment Creation (5 frameworks)** - How investment creates buying pressure
**4.4 Proof Methods (6 frameworks)** - Six ways to validate claims
**4.5 Holding Interest (3 frameworks)** - Techniques to prevent checkout

---

## 4.1 Middle Purposes (7 Frameworks)

### Framework 1: Keep Them Long Enough for Commitment to Form

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When planning presentation timing and structure.

**How It Works:**
Commitment is a TIME-BASED phenomenon. The longer someone stays engaged with your presentation, the more committed they become to taking action. Your first job is preventing early checkout.

**The Mechanism:**
- Minutes 1-10: Stop checkout, create interest
- Minutes 10-30: Build sequential agreement
- Minutes 30+: Commitment forms naturally through time investment

**Kennedy's Insight:**
Unlike one-to-one selling where you can adapt if someone tries to leave, in one-to-many they just check out mentally or physically. You must engineer the presentation to prevent this.

**Why It Matters:**
If they leave before commitment forms, all your content is wasted. Time on presentation equals commitment level.

---

### Framework 2: Create Emotional Attachment to You/Offer

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When determining Middle content mix—how much logic vs. emotion.

**How It Works:**
People buy emotionally and justify logically. The Middle must create EMOTIONAL attachment through:
- E-Factors (see 4.2)
- Stories that trigger emotional identification
- Future pacing emotional outcomes
- Addressing emotional pain points

**The Balance:**
They only need to know enough to buy. The rest should be motivating them ABOUT buying.

**Kennedy's Warning:**
Too much information, not enough emotion = no sales. "They only need to know enough to buy. You gain no leverage by giving them any more knowledge than what they need to buy."

**Why It Matters:**
Emotional attachment makes not buying feel like loss. Logic alone never creates urgency.

---

### Framework 3: Raise and Overcome Doubts/Objections

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When planning what objections to address and when.

**How It Works:**
In one-to-many, you cannot adjust to individual objections like one-to-one. You must handle EVERY possible objection during the presentation because there's no second chance.

**The Method:**
1. List every objection prospects might have
2. Raise each one preemptively (don't wait for them to think it)
3. Overcome it immediately with proof, logic, or emotional reassurance
4. Move forward with sequential agreement intact

**Kennedy's Approach:**
Raise doubts in order to erase them. Don't pretend objections don't exist—that makes them loom larger in prospect's mind.

**Why It Matters:**
Unaddressed objections become buying barriers. In one-to-many, you get no feedback about what's blocking them, so address everything.

---

### Framework 4: Sequential Agreement Building

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When structuring the logical flow of Middle content.

**How It Works:**
Get them saying "yes" mentally to a series of small agreements that build to the big yes (buying).

**The Structure:**
- Yes 1: Problem exists (they have it)
- Yes 2: Problem is costly/painful
- Yes 3: Current solutions don't work
- Yes 4: New solution is possible
- Yes 5: This solution is that new way
- Yes 6: I can do this
- Yes 7: I should act now

Each yes makes the next yes easier.

**Kennedy's Method:**
Use trial closes, rhetorical questions, and factual statements that require mental agreement. Stack them sequentially.

**Why It Matters:**
Someone who has said "yes" 15 times mentally is primed to say yes to the purchase. Sequential agreement creates momentum toward buying.

---

### Framework 5: Explanation (What They Need to Know to Buy)

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When deciding how much detail to include about how your solution works.

**How It Works:**
They need to know ENOUGH to buy, but not so much they feel they can do it themselves or are overwhelmed.

**The Balance:**
- Tell them WHAT to do and WHAT NOT to do
- Never tell them HOW to do it in step-by-step detail
- Create awareness of new method, not mastery

**Kennedy's Rule:**
"From a playing fair standpoint, you do no one any favors by just burying their butt in information. They won't go use it anyway. They can't."

**Example:**
In Magnetic Marketing speech, Kennedy explains WHAT a unique selling proposition is and WHY you need one. He shows Domino's example. He never gives templates or steps to BUILD one. People leave knowing they need one, knowing they don't have one, with zero idea how to create one.

**Why It Matters:**
Too much how-to makes them think they can do it alone (no sale) or overwhelms them (no action). Right amount creates need for your toolkit/coaching/done-for-you.

---

### Framework 6: Proof of Claims

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When making any significant claim about your offer.

**How It Works:**
Every major claim must be validated through one of six proof methods (see 4.4). The more demonstration you include, the better your results.

**Kennedy's Directive:**
"The more of it you do if you are doing one-to-many presentations that you are delivering live or by video, the more demonstration you do, the better that you will do."

**The Standard:**
Don't just assert—demonstrate, show, prove through multiple modalities.

**Why It Matters:**
Claims without proof are advertising. Claims with proof are sales presentations. The Middle is where you build the proof that makes the close work.

---

### Framework 7: Present Human Interest Stories

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When you need to make your content emotionally engaging and memorable.

**How It Works:**
Stories about real people experiencing the problem and finding the solution accomplish multiple goals:
- Make abstract concepts concrete
- Create emotional identification
- Provide proof through narrative
- Break up presentation pacing
- Make ideas sticky

**The Types:**
- Customer success stories
- Your own discovery journey
- Before/after transformations
- Cautionary tales (what happens without your solution)

**Kennedy's Use:**
"Al the Plumber" story in Magnetic Marketing speech summarizes all main points in one memorable, funny story that also sets up the reason to have resources.

**Why It Matters:**
People remember stories when they forget facts. Stories create emotional investment and demonstrate outcomes in relatable ways.

---

## 4.2 E-Factors (10 Frameworks)

### Overview: The Emotional Drivers of All Purchasing

E-Factors are the deep emotional motivations that drive every buying decision. Kennedy identified these as evergreen appeals that work across all markets and time periods.

**How to Use E-Factors:**
1. Identify which E-Factors your offer activates
2. Build secondary promises around each relevant E-Factor
3. Hit multiple E-Factors throughout Middle
4. Connect features to E-Factor benefits

---

### E-Factor 1: Love/Sex/Acceptance/Respect/Self-Respect

**The Drive:** Human need for connection, intimacy, and social acceptance.

**How to Activate:**
- "What will your spouse think when..."
- "Finally feel confident in social situations"
- "Respect yourself again"
- "The acceptance you've been craving"

**Examples:**
- Weight loss: "Feel attractive again"
- Business opportunity: "Earn your family's respect"
- Self-improvement: "Be the person you're proud to be"

---

### E-Factor 2: Popularity/Social Status

**The Drive:** Desire to be admired, envied, recognized as superior.

**How to Activate:**
- "Your friends will ask how you did it"
- "Be the envy of your neighborhood"
- "Join the elite few who..."
- Status symbols and positioning

**Kennedy's Example:**
Martha Stewart exists because of superiority appeal. "I can be superior to my other women friends if I have a Martha Stewart luncheon."

Starbucks is a superiority play: "People who are regular Starbucks customers feel superior to schmucks who buy their coffee at Dunkin' Donuts."

---

### E-Factor 3: Intelligence/"In the Know"

**The Drive:** Desire to be smart, informed, ahead of the curve.

**How to Activate:**
- "Little-known secret"
- "What the experts don't want you to know"
- "Be one of the few who understands"
- "Insider information"

**Why It Works:**
People want to feel smart and be seen as smart. Positioning your offer as "insider knowledge" elevates buyer status.

---

### E-Factor 4: Greed/Wealth/Power/Autonomy

**The Drive:** Financial opportunity, control, freedom from bosses/systems.

**How to Activate:**
- Money promises (evergreen appeal)
- "Be your own boss"
- "Financial freedom"
- "Power to make decisions"

**Kennedy's Note:**
"Financial is pretty much evergreen. It never goes away. People always want more money." Even billionaires in their 70s and 80s still keep score by money.

---

### E-Factor 5: Security/Safety/Protection

**The Drive:** Fear of loss, need for safety and stability.

**How to Activate:**
- Risk reversal/guarantees
- "Protect what you've worked for"
- "Safety net"
- "Peace of mind"

**Related Category:** Disaster prep (evergreen pitch category)

---

### E-Factor 6: Guilt/Shame/Regret vs. Peace of Mind

**The Drive:** Relief from negative emotions, redemption.

**How to Activate:**
- "Stop feeling guilty about..."
- "Finally forgive yourself for..."
- "Release the regret"
- "Sleep peacefully knowing..."

**Why It Works:**
People will pay to relieve emotional pain. Peace of mind is valuable.

---

### E-Factor 7: Pride/Ability/Achievement/Admiration/Envy

**The Drive:** Desire to accomplish, be admired, create envy.

**How to Activate:**
- "Achieve what others thought impossible"
- "Make them wonder how you did it"
- "Accomplishment you can be proud of"
- "Others will admire you for..."

---

### E-Factor 8: Goodness/Honesty

**The Drive:** Desire to be ethical, moral, good person.

**How to Activate:**
- Mission-driven positioning
- "Do the right thing"
- "Help others while helping yourself"
- Cause marketing

---

### E-Factor 9: Significance/Reason for Being

**The Drive:** Desire for meaning, purpose, legacy.

**How to Activate:**
- "Leave a legacy"
- "Make a difference"
- "Your purpose revealed"
- "Significance beyond yourself"

---

### E-Factor 10: Fear of Ill Health/Age/Death vs. Immortality

**The Drive:** Survival, longevity, vitality, staying young.

**How to Activate:**
- Anti-aging appeals
- Health transformation
- Vitality and energy
- "Live longer, live better"

**Kennedy's Note:**
Weight loss is an evergreen pitch that will never go away. "People were fat, are fat, will be fat forevermore."

---

## 4.3 Commitment Creation (5 Frameworks)

### Framework 1: Investment Level = Commitment Level

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
When planning presentation length and engagement requirements.

**How It Works:**
The more someone invests (time, mental energy, participation), the more committed they become to following through.

**The Psychology:**
Humans hate waste. If I've invested 90 minutes, I want that investment to pay off. Buying becomes the payoff. NOT buying means my investment was wasted.

**Kennedy's Statement:**
> "The more invested in buying a person is, the more likely they are to buy because not buying is now disappointing, frustrating, and failure."

**Application:**
- Longer presentations can sell higher-ticket items
- Participation increases investment (raise hands, take notes, complete exercises)
- Callbacks to earlier promises remind them of time invested

**Why It Matters:**
You're not just educating—you're creating investment that makes not buying painful.

---

### Framework 2: Not Buying = Disappointment (The Goal)

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
This is the GOAL of the entire Middle section.

**How It Works:**
Structure the Middle so that by the end, NOT buying feels like:
- Disappointment (I was excited, now I can't have it?)
- Frustration (I invested all this time for nothing?)
- Failure (I almost solved my problem but didn't)

**The Method:**
1. Create excitement about possibility
2. Make them see themselves succeeding
3. Get them emotionally attached to outcome
4. Build anticipation for having the solution
5. Make buying the only path to fulfillment of what you've created

**Kennedy's Directive:**
"The Middle's #1 job: Make not buying feel like disappointment."

**Why It Matters:**
If not buying feels neutral or relieving, you failed. Not buying must feel like loss.

---

### Framework 3: Time on Presentation = Commitment

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When planning presentation length and structure.

**How It Works:**
Simply staying for 60 minutes creates more commitment than staying for 20 minutes. Time investment is commitment.

**The Implication:**
- Don't rush
- Plan for appropriate length based on price point
- Use holding interest techniques (4.5) to keep them engaged
- Reference elapsed time strategically ("We've covered a lot in the last 45 minutes...")

**Why It Matters:**
Every additional minute someone stays increases likelihood of purchase.

---

### Framework 4: The Zappos Effect (Process Investment)

**Tier:** 3 (Solid Framework)

**When to Use:**
When deciding how much process to include in Middle.

**How It Works:**
Getting someone to participate in a PROCESS creates investment beyond passive listening.

**Examples:**
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises
- Diagnostic quizzes
- Worksheets completed during presentation
- Questions they answer mentally
- Hands raised for trial closes

**The Zappos Reference:**
Shopping process itself creates commitment (browsing, comparing, adding to cart). Each step increases likelihood of purchase.

**Kennedy's Use:**
In 3-hour Magnetic Marketing presentations, he'd bring people on stage to fill in template blanks live—demonstrating ease while creating investment.

**Why It Matters:**
Passive observers can walk away easily. Active participants are invested.

---

### Framework 5: Sequential Agreement Requirements

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When structuring logical flow of Middle.

**How It Works:**
Each agreement point creates micro-commitment. Stack them sequentially toward the buy decision.

**The Technique:**
Get them saying yes to:
- Problem statements
- Cost of problem
- Inadequacy of current solutions
- Possibility of new way
- Your credibility to deliver it
- Their ability to succeed with it
- Urgency of acting now

**Kennedy's Method:**
Use trial closes, rhetorical questions, and assertion + verification pattern throughout Middle.

**Why It Matters:**
Someone who has agreed 20 times is far more likely to agree to purchase than someone who has agreed 3 times.

---

## 4.4 Proof Methods (6 Frameworks)

### Overview: The Six Ways to Validate Claims

Kennedy identifies six primary proof methods. Use multiple methods for major claims. The more demonstration, the better the results.

---

### Proof Method 1: Science/Junk Science/Fake Science

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When you need logical, credible proof (especially health, technical products).

**How It Works:**
Reference:
- Real scientific studies
- Clinical trials
- Research data
- Expert analysis

**Kennedy's Candid Note:**
He distinguishes between real science, junk science (weak methodology), and fake science (made up). All can work if presented credibly, but real science is strongest.

**Example Structure:**
"The Harvard study showed that 9 out of 10 dentists recommend X, which is exactly why you can rely on X to get your teeth three shades whiter in just three days."

**Why It Matters:**
Science provides logical justification for emotional buying decision.

---

### Proof Method 2: Authority/Borrowed Authority/Fake Authority

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When you need credibility through association.

**How It Works:**
- **Real Authority:** Your credentials, experience, achievements
- **Borrowed Authority:** Endorsements from credible figures
- **Fake Authority:** Creating appearance of authority without substance

**Application:**
- Expert positioning
- Credentials display
- Celebrity endorsements
- Industry recognition
- Awards and certifications

**Why It Matters:**
People follow authority. If you're the authority (or endorsed by authority), your claims carry more weight.

---

### Proof Method 3: Celebrity

**Tier:** 3 (Solid Framework)

**When to Use:**
When you have celebrity endorsements or can position yourself as celebrity.

**How It Works:**
Celebrity creates:
- Attention
- Borrowed credibility
- Social proof
- Aspiration

**Kennedy's Use:**
References Zig Ziglar, Gary Halbert, Jay Abraham throughout to borrow their celebrity in marketing world.

**Why It Matters:**
Celebrity shortcircuits skepticism. "If it's good enough for [celebrity], it's good enough for me."

---

### Proof Method 4: Social/Peer Proof (One-to-One or Aggregate)

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
Always. This is the most versatile and powerful proof method.

**How It Works:**
- **One-to-one:** Individual testimonial stories
- **Aggregate:** "Join 50,000 satisfied customers"

**The Power:**
People follow what other people like them are doing. Social proof removes risk and creates bandwagon effect.

**Application:**
- Testimonials (written, audio, video)
- Success stories
- User count
- Social media proof
- Before/after comparisons with attribution

**Kennedy's Standard:**
Testimonials should reinforce key promises and appear throughout Middle, not just at end.

**Why It Matters:**
Social proof answers the question: "Am I the first person to try this risky thing?" Answer must be: "No, thousands went before you successfully."

---

### Proof Method 5: Demonstration

**Tier:** 1 (Master System)

**When to Use:**
Whenever possible. Kennedy says this is THE most powerful proof.

**How It Works:**
SHOW, don't just tell. Demonstrate:
- Product in action
- Results being produced
- Process being completed
- Before/after live
- Transformation happening

**Kennedy's Types of Demonstration:**
1. **Profound Importance Demo:** Make ordinary demo extraordinary (Houdini hanging from crane vs. on stage)
2. **Product Performance:** Showing product working
3. **Personal Wizardry:** Hot seats, live consulting, problem-solving on stage
4. **Safety in Numbers:** Showing large crowds, social proof visually
5. **Happy Outcomes:** Lifestyle visuals, transformation evidence

**Example:**
Daily Cash in the Mailbox infomercial—opening actual mail and counting actual checks on stage.

**Kennedy's Directive:**
"The more demonstration you do, the better that you will do."

**Why It Matters:**
Demonstration overcomes skepticism better than any other method. Seeing is believing.

---

### Proof Method 6: Before/After

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When transformation is core to your offer.

**How It Works:**
Show the contrast:
- Before state (painful, broken, struggling)
- After state (transformed, successful, thriving)
- The gap between them (your solution)

**Application:**
- Weight loss photos
- Financial statements (broke → wealthy)
- Business metrics (failing → thriving)
- Lifestyle changes (stressed → peaceful)

**Why It Matters:**
Before/after makes transformation visual and concrete. People can see themselves in the before, desire the after.

---

## 4.5 Holding Interest (3 Frameworks)

### Framework 1: Mixed Content

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When planning presentation flow to prevent boredom.

**How It Works:**
Alternate between content types to maintain engagement:
- Stories
- Humor
- Demonstration
- Information/teaching
- Testimonials
- Q&A or interaction

**Kennedy's Warning:**
"No fun. Buying is supposed to be fun. People shop for fun."

**The Method:**
Never deliver more than 10 minutes of the same type of content. Vary constantly.

**Example:**
Information → Story → Demo → Testimonial → Humor → Information

**Why It Matters:**
Monotony causes checkout. Variety maintains attention and engagement.

---

### Framework 2: Mixed Media

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When planning presentation visual elements and format.

**How It Works:**
Vary the delivery medium:
- Photos
- Cartoons
- Video clips
- Text/slides
- Live demonstration
- Product shots
- Graphics/charts

**Kennedy's Example:**
World Showcase at Disney—each "country" uses different format (movie, store, restaurant, street performance) to maintain interest while people shop.

**Application:**
Don't talk to slides for 60 minutes. Mix:
- Direct-to-camera
- Slides
- Video testimonials
- Product demonstrations
- B-roll footage
- Screen shares

**Why It Matters:**
Visual variety prevents fatigue and maintains engagement over longer presentations.

---

### Framework 3: Pace and Momentum

**Tier:** 2 (Core Framework)

**When to Use:**
When structuring presentation timing and energy.

**How It Works:**
Create feeling that they must work to keep up, but don't lose them completely.

**The Balance:**
- Fast enough: Creates excitement, urgency, momentum
- Not so fast: They get lost and check out

**Kennedy's Technique:**
- Vary pace deliberately (fast sections, breathing room, fast again)
- Build momentum toward close
- Use energy shifts to signal transitions
- Never drag or stall

**The Feel:**
They should feel: "This is moving fast, I better pay attention" NOT "I'm lost, I give up."

**Why It Matters:**
Pace creates energy. Energy creates excitement. Excitement creates buying emotion.

---

## Kennedy's Key Content Principles

### Principle 1: Middle's #1 Job
Make not buying feel like disappointment.

### Principle 2: The 7-21 Repetition Rule
Need 7 to 21 repetitions of key ideas in different ways for them to stick.

**Kennedy's Example:**
"If you move into a new house, for at least seven nights, like an idiot, you will be in the dark reaching for the light switches where they were in the old house."

**Application:**
Build 7-21 repetitions of most important buying belief within presentation through:
- Direct assertion
- Demonstration
- Testimonials
- Stories
- Headlines of stories
- Proffer of facts
- Guarantee
- Trial closes

### Principle 3: Tell WHAT and WHAT NOT, Never HOW
"Tell them what to do and what NOT to do, but never telling them how to do it."

**Why:**
If you teach them HOW step-by-step, they either:
1. Think they can do it themselves (no sale)
2. Get overwhelmed (no action)

Create awareness, create need, but leave the implementation to your product/service.

### Principle 4: Handle Every Possible Objection
"In one-to-many, you cannot adjust like one-to-one selling, so you must handle EVERY possible objection."

There's no second chance to address concerns. Build objection handling throughout Middle.

### Principle 5: E-Factors Are the Real Drivers
"E-Factors are the emotional drivers of all purchasing."

Logic supports. Emotion drives. Hit multiple E-Factors throughout Middle.

---

## How to Use These Frameworks

### Step 1: Define Middle Purposes
What must your Middle accomplish?
- Keep them engaged for X minutes
- Create emotional attachment to outcome
- Raise and overcome objections A, B, C
- Build sequential agreement through Y points
- Provide proof of claims

### Step 2: Identify Relevant E-Factors
Which emotional drivers does your offer activate?
- Which E-Factors are strongest for your market?
- How will you trigger each one?
- Where in Middle will each appear?

### Step 3: Structure for Commitment Creation
- How long must they stay for commitment to form?
- What investment (beyond time) can you require?
- How will you make not buying feel like disappointment?

### Step 4: Plan Proof Strategy
For each major claim:
- Which proof method(s) will you use?
- Can you demonstrate it live?
- What testimonials reinforce it?
- What authority backs it?

### Step 5: Design for Sustained Interest
- Map content type variety (story, info, demo, humor)
- Plan media changes (slides, video, live, product)
- Establish pace and momentum
- Identify 7-21 repetition points for key idea

### Step 6: Validate Structure
- Does Middle create investment?
- Are all objections addressed?
- Is emotional attachment being built?
- Are E-Factors activated?
- Is key idea repeated 7-21 times?
- Would not buying feel disappointing?

---

## Common Middle Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Complicated
"People that make this mistake the most are people who for one reason or another feel compelled to teach."

**The Fix:** Simplify ruthlessly. One media example. Three steps, not seventeen. They can't handle complexity in first exposure.

### Mistake 2: Lost Connections
"When things aren't hooked together for them, if you leave it up to them to make the connections, they will get lost."

**The Fix:** Explicitly connect each section to previous and next. Don't assume they're following your logic.

### Mistake 3: Too Much Information, Not Enough Emotion
"They only need to know enough to buy. The rest of the time ought to be motivating them about buying."

**The Fix:** Cut information by 50%. Replace with stories, future pacing, E-Factor triggers.

### Mistake 4: No Fun
"Buying is supposed to be fun. People shop for fun."

**The Fix:** Add humor, entertainment, personality. Don't be serious from beginning to end.

### Mistake 5: Raising Doubt Instead of Creating Reassurance
Explaining too much complexity, using technical language, showing all the hard parts.

**The Fix:** Reassure constantly. Make it sound simple, doable, supported.

---

## Structure of Promises

### Primary Promise
The one big thing they get. Make it as big and bold as you can fulfill.

**Kennedy's Examples:**
- "Learn the secrets of people who never get sick" (vs. weak: "Learn how to boost your immune system")
- "Grow twice the garden for half the cost and make your neighbors green with envy" (vs. weak: "50 tips for a more bountiful garden")

### Secondary Promises
Support the primary promise in different benefit categories:

**Three Types of Secondary Benefits:**
1. **Actual benefits:** What they tangibly get
2. **How they feel:** Emotional state from having it
3. **How others feel about them:** Social/status benefits

**Kennedy's Example:**
Primary: "End cold prospecting forever"
Secondary (actual): Save 10 hours per week
Secondary (how they feel): Relief, confidence
Secondary (how others see them): Respect, envy from other salespeople

### The Wheel Method
Primary promise in center, secondary promises on spokes:
- Money
- Love/sex
- Family
- Health
- Security
- Status
- Lifestyle

You only need one of each. Don't go over five secondaries.

### Stacked Promises
When time-tight, stack 2-3 promises in one concise statement.

**Examples:**
- "Grow Rich with Peace of Mind" (Napoleon Hill)
- "Win Friends and Influence People" (Carnegie)
- "Conquer the chaos. How to (1) grow a successful small business (2) without going crazy."

### The "Without" Structure
Promise what they WANT without what they DON'T want.

**Template:** "How to [desired outcome] without [feared cost/effort]"

**Kennedy's Example:**
"How to instantly add high ticket sales to your sales funnel without personally talking on the phone to anyone ever."

---

## The 7 to 21 Times Repetition System

### Why It Works
Kennedy's explanation:

> "If you move into a new house, then depending upon how quick a study you are, but at least for seven nights, like an idiot, you will be in the dark reaching for the light switches where they were in the old house. Most people will be reaching for the light switches where they were in the old house for 21 nights in a row before their hand and mind readjusts."

Repetition creates automatic neural patterns. Same applies to ideas.

### How to Deliver 7-21 Repetitions Without Being Clumsy

**10 Ways to Repeat Your Key Idea:**

1. **Opening tease** - State it in first 3 minutes
2. **Direct assertion** - Say it plainly
3. **Inside demonstration** - Show it, prove it
4. **Inside testimonials** - Have others say it
5. **Inside story** - Make it the moral
6. **Headline of story** - Announce story with the idea
7. **Punchline of story** - End story by restating idea
8. **Proffer of facts** - "The study showed X, which is exactly why [key idea]"
9. **Inside guarantee** - "If you don't [key idea] within 89 days..."
10. **Trial closes** - "Wouldn't it be great if [key idea]?"

### The Closed Loop Structure

Kennedy reveals the self-proving circular technique:

**Formula:**
Start with promise → Middle that doesn't prove it → End with "that fact proves..." → Restate original promise

**Example:**
"Incredibly, most sales professionals choose to be miserable while a few choose to prosper and enjoy selling. [Middle content about magnetic marketing.] That fact guarantees that you can choose freedom from prospecting drudgery while others choose misery."

The "fact" being referenced is simply a restatement of the opening promise. It's circular, but it works.

---

## Bookending and Primacy/Recency

### The Law of Primacy and Recency
People remember:
- First things (primacy)
- Last things (recency)
- Almost nothing from the middle

### Application
**Bookend everything:**
- Start of presentation and end of presentation
- Start of section and end of section
- Start of story and end of story
- Start of paragraph and end of paragraph

**The Method:**
State key idea → Supporting content → Restate key idea

### Summary Statements
In longer presentations, stop periodically to summarize:

**Kennedy's Example:**
"Okay, now we have got message taken care of. Now we will... Okay, now we have message and market. Now we will go to media."

Each summary creates a primacy/recency loop and prevents Middle muddle.
