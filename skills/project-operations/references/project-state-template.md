## Current State

### What's Working
- [List functioning components/completed work]
- Example: "Vision document validated and approved"
- Example: "Architecture map created with 4 main systems"

### Blockers
- [List or "None"]
- Example: "Waiting for API credentials from client"
- Example: "Need clarification on email frequency preference"

### Quality Scores (Recent)
- [Recent quality gate results]
- Example: "Architecture Gate: PASS (all criteria met)"
- Example: "Capability Gate: PASS (6 capabilities defined, all testable)"

### Sub-Agents (if using Dispatcher/Manager)
- [Active/completed sub-agents with status]
- Example: "Dr. Elena Vasquez: Research sub-agent - Completed (quality score: 88%)"
- Example: "Marcus Chen: Creative ideation - In Progress"

   - How: [method/approach]
   - Done when: [completion criteria]
   - Estimated time: [if known]

2. **[Specific action with acceptance criteria]**
   - What: ...
   - Done when: ...

3. **[Specific action with acceptance criteria]**
   - What: ...
   - Done when: ...

**RULE:** These should be concrete, actionable steps that the next session can execute immediately without re-planning.

## Operating Mode Notes

[Any mode-specific information]

### If Autonomous Mode:
- Agent proceeds independently per Core Agent Operations protocols
- Interrupts only for criteria in project CLAUDE.md
- Logs all progress to PROGRESS-LOG

### If Dispatcher/Manager Mode:
- Main agent orchestrates, never does work directly
- Sub-agents assigned personas from library
- Quality thresholds: STANDARD 70% / ELEVATED 85% / CRITICAL 95%
- Retry protocol: max 3 attempts, then escalate

### If Strategic Builder Mode:
- Following translation stack: Vision → Architecture → Capability → Phased Delivery → Prototype → PRD → Build → Validation
- Validation gates enforced at each level
- Cannot proceed to next level until current level passes gate

## Notes & Context

[Any additional context that doesn't fit above categories]

Example:
- Client prefers async communication, check email daily
- Health compliance review required before publishing any content
- Budget constraint: max 40 hours for Phase 1
- Working in collaboration with [other person/team]
