# Fladlien Funnel Frameworks

Complete framework set for everything before and after the live webinar—because funnel optimization often matters MORE than webinar optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

- Optimizing webinar registration pages
- Improving show rates
- Creating email sequences
- Building replay systems
- Understanding funnel math

**Key Insight:** Replay gets 4x the eyeballs of live. Optimize both!

## Frameworks Included (6)

### Core Frameworks (King/Queen)
- **F3. Sign-Up Page Formula** - Mirrors close sequence on sales page
- **F4. Replay Architecture** - Gets 4x eyeballs of live (technical requirements)

### Supporting Frameworks (Jack/10)
- **F1. Registration Page Principle** - Treat like order form, NOT sales page
- **F2. Thank-You Page Objectives** - Show rate + inbox relationship only
- **F5. Attrition Math Model** - Where you're losing people (50K → 20 sales)
- **F6. Six-Email Sequence** - 3 to live + 3 to replay

## How to Use

1. **Understand the Math** - Use F5 (Attrition Math) to see where you lose people
2. **Optimize Pre-Webinar** - Use F1-F2 and F6 (first 3 emails) to maximize show rate
3. **Optimize Post-Webinar** - Use F3-F4 and F6 (last 3 emails) to maximize replay conversions
4. **Measure and Iterate** - Track each stage, find highest-leverage improvements

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Attrition Math Reality

**F5. Attrition Math Model** - Why funnel optimization matters

```
50,000 email list
   ↓ (20% open rate)
10,000 open email
   ↓ (20% click rate)
2,000 click registration link
   ↓ (50% register)
1,000 register for webinar
   ↓ (50% show rate)
500 attend live
   ↓ (40% make it to close)
200 at close section
   ↓ (10% conversion)
20 sales
```

**Key Insight:** Improving show rate from 50% to 60% = 240 people at close instead of 200 = 24 sales instead of 20 = 20% revenue increase!

Funnel optimization often has bigger impact than webinar optimization.

## Pre-Webinar Funnel

### F1. Registration Page Principle

**"Treat like order form, NOT sales page"**

Why:
- They've already decided to attend (from email)
- Your job: Make registration frictionless
- Don't re-sell them on attending

Structure:
- Headline emphasizes SCARCITY (limited spots, filling fast)
- Clear form (minimal fields)
- Strong urgency (countdown, limited availability)
- Clear call-to-action

**Don't:**
- Long benefit copy (they're already sold)
- Testimonials about webinar (save for webinar itself)
- Lengthy explanations (just get them registered)

---

### F2. Thank-You Page Objectives

**Two objectives only:**

1. **Increase Show Rate**
   - Tell them what to expect
   - How long it will be
   - What they'll learn
   - When it starts
   - How to access

2. **Establish Inbox Relationship**
   - "You'll receive emails from [email address]"
   - "Here's what the subject line will look like..."
   - "Add me to your contacts to ensure delivery"
   - Show sample email

**Don't:**
- Sell other products
- Overwhelm with information
- Create confusion

**Keep it simple:** Get them to show up.

---

### F6. Six-Email Sequence (Part 1: To Live)

**Email 1: Confirmation + What to Expect** (Immediately after registration)
- Confirm registration
- Webinar date/time (in their timezone)
- What they'll learn (3-5 bullets)
- Add to calendar link
- Set expectations

**Email 2: Reminder** (Day before webinar)
- Reminder of date/time
- Quick benefit recap (2-3 bullets)
- "Clear your calendar" urgency
- Show up with questions ready

**Email 3: Starting Now!** (At webinar start time)
- "We're starting right now!"
- Click here to join
- Don't miss first 5 minutes (authority/testimonials)
- Last chance to join live

---

## Post-Webinar Funnel

### F3. Sign-Up Page Formula

**Structure mirrors close sequence:**

1. **Recap Benefits** - What they learned, transformation promised
2. **Scarcity** - Deadline, limited quantity, bonuses expiring
3. **Offer Details** - What's included (brief, links to components)
4. **Bonuses** - Full bonus stack with value
5. **Guarantee** - Risk reversal
6. **Testimonials** - Sidebar (social proof)
7. **FAQ** - Common objections handled
8. **Multiple CTAs** - Top, middle, bottom

**Key:** This is your sales page. It mirrors everything from close, but in written form.

### F4. Replay Architecture

**Technical requirements for maximum conversion:**

✓ **Expire with offer** - Creates urgency (countdown visible)
✓ **Autoplay** - Reduce friction (starts immediately)
✓ **Responsive** - Mobile matters (50%+ watch on mobile)
✓ **Low bitrate** - Fast loading (don't lose them to buffering)
✓ **Delayed buy button** - Can't skip to purchase (must watch value)

**Why replay matters:**
- Gets 4x the eyeballs of live
- People can watch on their schedule
- Can pause and come back
- Less technical issues than live

**Optimize replay experience as much as live experience!**

---

### F6. Six-Email Sequence (Part 2: To Replay)

**Email 4: Replay Available** (Immediately after live ends)
- "Missed the webinar? Replay available now"
- Or "Want to watch again? Replay ready"
- Deadline emphasized (expires in 48 hours)
- Clear link to replay page

**Email 5: Key Takeaways + Link** (12-18 hours after live)
- "Here's what you missed..." (3-5 key insights)
- Brief testimonials from attendees
- Reminder: Replay expires in 30 hours
- Link to replay

**Email 6: Last Chance** (2-4 hours before expiration)
- "Expiring in [X] hours"
- This is truly your last chance
- Bonuses expire when replay comes down
- Final link to replay
- Urgency maximized

## Core Funnel Principles

1. **Math matters** - Small improvements compound (F5)
2. **Registration ≠ Sales page** - Minimize friction (F1)
3. **Show rate is king** - Get them to actually attend (F2)
4. **Replay = 4x live** - Optimize replay experience (F4)
5. **Email sequence critical** - 3 to live, 3 to replay (F6)
6. **Sales page mirrors close** - Use same sequence (F3)

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1:** Over-selling on registration page
- Violates Registration Page Principle
- They're already sold—just get them registered

**Mistake #2:** Complicated thank-you page
- Violates Thank-You Page Objectives
- Two goals only: show rate + inbox

**Mistake #3:** Weak email sequence
- Not enough urgency
- Not enough value reminders
- Missing emails (must send all 6)

**Mistake #4:** Poor replay experience
- Doesn't autoplay
- Slow loading
- Not mobile-responsive
- These kill conversions

**Mistake #5:** No deadline on replay
- Violates Replay Architecture
- Must expire with offer to create urgency

## Validation Questions

**Before launching funnel:**
- Does registration page minimize friction? (F1)
- Does thank-you page focus on two objectives only? (F2)
- Do I have all six emails written? (F6)
- Does replay meet technical requirements? (F4)
- Does sales page mirror close sequence? (F3)
- Do I understand my attrition math? (F5)
