# Fladlien Delivery Frameworks

Presentation craft frameworks that apply to ALL sections—these are about HOW you present, not WHAT you present.

## When to Use This Skill

- Polishing slide decks
- Improving visual presentation
- Cutting excess content
- Adding authenticity to presentation
- Final refinement before going live

**Note:** These frameworks apply across all webinar sections (intro, content, transition, close).

## Frameworks Included (4)

### Supporting Frameworks (Jack/10)
- **G1. Show-and-Tell Principle** - Real > Polished (show actual leaderboard, not slide)
- **G2. Slide Iteration Process** - Words → Notes → Visuals (one slide becomes seven)
- **G3. Defocus Animation** - Blur everything except focus point
- **G4. 25% Content Cut Rule** - Cut 25% after first pass (easier to subtract than add)

## How to Use

1. **Add Authenticity** - Use G1 (Show-and-Tell) to replace polished with real
2. **Iterate Slides** - Use G2 (Slide Iteration) to make slides visual, not text-heavy
3. **Control Focus** - Use G3 (Defocus Animation) to direct attention
4. **Cut Ruthlessly** - Use G4 (25% Cut Rule) to remove excess

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework descriptions.

## The Four Presentation Principles

### G1. Show-and-Tell Principle

**"Real > Polished"**

**Examples:**
- Show actual leaderboard screenshot, not slide with numbers
- Share actual email from customer, not sanitized testimonial
- Display real product interface, not mockup
- Show actual support portal, not description

**Why it works:**
- Authenticity builds trust
- Raw beats professional polish
- Hard to fake real screenshots
- Creates believability

**Where to apply:**
- Authority section (real results screenshots)
- Testimonials (actual emails, texts, screenshots)
- Component presentation (real product, not mockup)
- Guarantee (actual support portal interface)

**Don't:**
- Use stock photos when you can show real
- Create polished graphics when actual screenshots work
- Sanitize testimonials to perfection

### G2. Slide Iteration Process

**"Words → Notes → Visuals"**

**The three-step transformation:**

**STEP 1: Write all words on slide**
- Get ideas down
- Don't worry about visuals yet
- Just capture the content

**STEP 2: Move words to speaker notes**
- Everything you wrote goes to notes
- Slide now becomes placeholder
- You have full script in notes

**STEP 3: Replace with visuals only**
- Remove all text from slide
- Add images, diagrams, minimal text
- One original slide often becomes 5-7 visual slides

**Result:**
- Visual, engaging slides
- Not text-heavy PowerPoint
- You tell the story, slides support

**Example:**
- Original: One slide with 10 bullet points
- After iteration: Seven slides with one image each

### G3. Defocus Animation

**"Blur everything except focus point"**

**The technique:**
```
[████ ░░░░ ░░░░]  →  [░░░░ ████ ░░░░]  →  [░░░░ ░░░░ ████]
Focus Blur  Blur      Blur Focus Blur      Blur  Blur Focus
```

**How it works:**
- Show full roadmap/structure
- Blur everything except current section
- As you progress, shift focus
- Always clear where you are

**Where to apply:**
- C9. Roadmap Reveal (show where in content)
- E1. Close Sequence (guide through stages)
- E10. Bonus Compounding (highlight current bonus)
- Any multi-step process

**Why it works:**
- Eliminates confusion
- Shows progress
- Maintains context
- Professional polish

**Implementation:**
- PowerPoint: Animation effects
- Keynote: Magic Move transitions
- Or: Simple highlighting/dimming

### G4. 25% Content Cut Rule

**"Cut 25% after first pass"**

**The discipline:**

```
ORIGINAL CONTENT  →  AFTER FIRST PASS  →  FINAL
████████████         █████████            ██████
(Too much)           (-25%)               (Right amount)
```

**Why it works:**
- Easier to subtract than add
- Most people overcomplicate
- Respects their time and attention
- "Less is more" (Value Paradox)

**How to apply:**
1. Create your content (don't hold back)
2. Complete first full draft
3. Review and cut 25%
4. Results in tight, focused content

**What to cut:**
- Redundant examples
- Tangential points
- "Nice to know" vs "Need to know"
- Stories that don't serve outcome

**Works with:**
- C1. Value Paradox ("Less is more")
- C8. 3-to-5 Step Constraint (limit steps)
- E2. Offer Minimization (brief on offer)

**Don't:**
- Skip the cutting phase
- Think "more content = more value"
- Add back what you cut

## How These Apply to Each Section

### Introduction
- **G1 (Show-and-Tell):** Real testimonials, actual results screenshots
- **G2 (Slide Iteration):** Authority visuals, not text lists
- **G4 (25% Cut):** Keep intro tight (15 minutes max)

### Content
- **G1 (Show-and-Tell):** Real examples, actual case studies
- **G2 (Slide Iteration):** Visual teaching, not bullet points
- **G3 (Defocus):** Roadmap with current step highlighted
- **G4 (25% Cut):** Honor Value Paradox, cut extra steps

### Transition
- **G2 (Slide Iteration):** Minimal slides (4 slides for 4 steps)
- **G4 (25% Cut):** Keep it 3-5 minutes (don't expand)

### Close
- **G1 (Show-and-Tell):** Real product, actual member area
- **G2 (Slide Iteration):** Visual bonus presentations
- **G3 (Defocus):** Highlight current bonus in stack
- **G4 (25% Cut):** Brief on offer (violate = E2 Minimization)

## Core Delivery Principles

1. **Real > Polished** - Authenticity beats professional graphics
2. **Visual > Text** - Slides support, don't duplicate what you say
3. **Focus > Confusion** - Always clear where you are
4. **Less > More** - Cut 25%, improve clarity

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1:** Using stock photos instead of real screenshots
- Violates Show-and-Tell Principle
- Reduces credibility

**Mistake #2:** Text-heavy slides
- Violates Slide Iteration Process
- They read instead of listen

**Mistake #3:** No visual navigation
- Makes them lost in content
- Violates Defocus Animation opportunity

**Mistake #4:** Not cutting content
- Violates 25% Cut Rule
- Violates Value Paradox

## Validation Questions

**Before going live:**
- Am I showing real vs polished? (G1)
- Are my slides visual, not text-heavy? (G2)
- Do I show progress/focus throughout? (G3)
- Have I cut 25% of my content? (G4)

## The Polish Workflow

**After content is created:**

1. Apply G4 (Cut 25%)
2. Apply G2 (Iterate slides to visuals)
3. Apply G1 (Replace polished with real)
4. Apply G3 (Add defocus/navigation)
5. Final review
6. Ship
