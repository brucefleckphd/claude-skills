# Carlton Turbulence - Steps 15-16 of the Simple Writing System

"The stuff you're gonna need to get people to take action / to get them off the fence."

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating urgency in sales copy
- Adding scarcity elements
- Designing takeaway strategies
- Planning bonuses to push conversions
- Getting fence-sitters to act

## The Turbulence Philosophy

### Beyond Simple Urgency

> "People use the word 'urgency', but it's really turbulence."

Turbulence is getting a notion into somebody's head that's NOT going to let them go until they come around to your way of thinking.

### The Goal

> "Create 'turbulence' in the reader's mind, make him unable to sleep."
>
> "I've been told some people have read my copy, gone to sleep, then woken up in the middle of the night and bought."

### The Standard Stuff Isn't Enough

> "Don't think about 'There's only 15 here. Once they're all gone they're gone.' That's the standard stuff."

You need to go deeper.

## Step 15: The Tools of Turbulence

### 1. URGENCY

Time-based pressure to act now.

**Types:**
- Deadline (hard end date)
- Limited time pricing
- Event-based (launch ends, webinar starts)
- Seasonal/timely relevance

**Example:**
> "This is a special privilege I'm offering ONLY to guys like you on our 'Hot List'... and ONLY in the order you are on that list."

### 2. LIMITATIONS

Quantity or access restrictions.

**Types:**
- Limited quantity
- Limited spots
- Limited access
- First-come, first-served

**Note on digital products:**
> "Limits on quantity online were never believable, because you can make unlimited copies."

**What works instead:**
- Limits of TIME, not quantity
- Limits of AVAILABILITY (cohort-based)
- Limits of SUPPORT (only X people can get personal attention)

### 3. TAKEAWAY

Fear of being left out or missing the opportunity.

**Classic format:**
> "If you don't want it, do nothing... and we'll take your name off the package, and send it to the guy below you on the list..."

**Psychology:**
We want what we might not be able to have. Takeaway activates loss aversion.

### 4. OPPORTUNITY

Framing this as a unique chance that may not come again.

**Types:**
- Once-in-a-lifetime
- Market timing
- First-mover advantage
- Window of opportunity

## Digital Products Turbulence

### The Challenge

Can't use old classic physical takeaways (limited inventory, etc.)

### What Works for Digital

**The One Time Offer (OTO):**
> "Prospect can only see the page one time, must make a decision."

The closest thing there is online to physical scarcity.

**The Market Test:**
> "We're just testing the market with this product. Price is never gonna be less but it could be a lot more. I have a suspicion we put way too much stuff into this package, we'll probably have to scale it back soon."

**Evergreen Turbulence:**
For sites you're not going to change:
- "I may pull this site down at any time."
- "Price could go up at any time."

**Time-Limited Access:**
- Enrollment periods
- Cohort starts
- Cart close dates

## Step 16: Knock 'Em Off The Fence

### The Bonus Strategy

> "The quickest way to boost response of an old ad is to create some free bonuses."

**Key insight:**
> "Sometimes people will order just for a single bonus. The stick letter will convince them they want the whole thing."

### Bonus Requirements

Each bonus should:
1. Be valuable on its own
2. Be worth buying separately
3. Add to the main offer (not random)
4. Have its own appeal

### Stacking Effect

More isn't always better, but PERCEIVED VALUE matters. Stack bonuses to create overwhelming value.

## Turbulence Templates

### Template 1: The Hot List Takeaway

> "This is a special privilege I'm offering ONLY to guys like you on our 'Hot List'... and ONLY in the order you are on that list. By getting this letter, you have earned a spot up the list, so there's a package here for you.
>
> If you don't want it, do nothing... and we'll take your name off the package, and send it to the guy below you on the list..."

### Template 2: The "7 Reasons" Reverse

> "The 7 Reasons Attractive Women Choose Other Men Over You"
> ...and what to do about it, today...

Creates urgency through fear of continued loss.

### Template 3: The Market Test

> "We're testing this offer with a small group first. The price will never be this low again - we suspect we've packed too much value in and will need to scale back or raise the price significantly."

### Template 4: The Price Increase Warning

> "Fair warning: I'm raising the price on [date]. I've kept it artificially low during this launch, but it needs to reflect the true value. If you're on the fence, now is the time."

### Template 5: The Cohort Close

> "This training starts [date]. We only accept [number] students per cohort to ensure everyone gets attention. Once we're full, you'll have to wait until the next round - and there's no guarantee when that will be."

### Template 6: The Bonus Deadline

> "Order by [date] and I'll include [bonus] - worth $XXX on its own. After [date], this bonus disappears and won't be offered again."

## What NOT to Do

### Fake Scarcity

Don't claim scarcity you can't back up. Digital products with "only 50 copies" are obviously fake.

### Hollow Urgency

"Act now!" without a reason isn't turbulence - it's noise.

### Threatening Tone

Turbulence should create unease, not anger. You're helping them see the opportunity, not threatening them.

## Mandatory Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Turbulence Type
Which tool fits your offer?
- [ ] Urgency (time-based)
- [ ] Limitations (quantity/access-based)
- [ ] Takeaway (loss aversion)
- [ ] Opportunity (unique chance)

### Step 2: Make It Real
For your chosen type:
- [ ] Is it truthful?
- [ ] Is it believable?
- [ ] Can you enforce it?
- [ ] Does it make sense for the offer?

### Step 3: Design Bonus Stack
For fence-sitters:
- [ ] What bonuses add value?
- [ ] Are they worth buying alone?
- [ ] Do they complement the main offer?
- [ ] Is the stack overwhelming (in a good way)?

### Step 4: Create Turbulence Copy
Write the actual turbulence section:
- [ ] Clear deadline or limitation
- [ ] Consequence of not acting
- [ ] Reason it's limited
- [ ] Specific action to take

### Step 5: Sleepless Night Test
Would this:
- [ ] Make them think about it later?
- [ ] Create unease if they don't act?
- [ ] Stick in their mind?
- [ ] Push them over the edge?

## Turbulence Psychology

### Why It Works

**Loss Aversion:**
People fear losing more than they desire gaining. Takeaway triggers this.

**Opportunity Cost:**
Making them feel what they'll miss, not just what they'll get.

**Decisional Closure:**
The human brain craves resolution. Turbulence creates an open loop that demands closing.

**Social Proof Pressure:**
"Others are taking this while you're thinking" creates competitive anxiety.

### The Key Insight

Turbulence isn't about pressure. It's about making the decision feel UNFINISHED until they act.

> "Getting a notion into somebody's head that's not going to let them go until they come around to your way of thinking."
