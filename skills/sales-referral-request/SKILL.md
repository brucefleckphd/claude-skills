# Request Referrals

Turn happy clients into lead generation machines. This skill creates natural, non-pushy referral requests that actually get responses.

## When to Use This Skill

- After delivering successful results
- During quarterly business reviews
- When clients express satisfaction
- Post-testimonial or case study
- Milestone celebrations

## Required Inputs

- Client name and company
- Results you've delivered for them
- Specific wins or metrics
- Type of referral you want (industry, role, use case)
- Any specific people they might know

## Instructions

1. **Identify timing** - Right moment in relationship
2. **Choose approach** - Direct ask vs. soft introduction
