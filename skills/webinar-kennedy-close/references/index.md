## Framework Index by Tier

### TIER 1: FOUNDATION (2 frameworks)

**1. Clearly Understood Offer** (6.2)
- **What**: Before anything else, they must understand EXACTLY what they're getting
- **When**: Every single presentation (non-negotiable)
- **Key Quote**: "If they don't understand what the offer is, if they're confused about it, you're not going to get a sale."
- **Components**: Name, components list, delivery method, timing, outcome

**2. Believed Scarcity/Exclusivity** (6.3)
- **What**: Scarcity only works if they BELIEVE it. Key word: believed.
- **When**: Every close (but choose believable type)
- **Key Quote**: "People will wait. So they're asked, believed scarcity. Key word here is believed. You have to find ways to make it believable."
- **Hierarchy**: Physical constraints > Bonus disappearance > Price increases > Generic claims

---

### TIER 2: STRATEGIC (3 frameworks)

**3. Irresistible Offer Structure (Price to Value)** (6.2)
- **What**: The relationship between price and value determines whether it's irresistible
- **When**: Every purchase presentation
- **Math**: If Value Gap > 3x Price → Irresistible
- **Process**: Core value + Bonuses = Total Value → Reveal actual price → Show gap

**4. Reason Why for Urgency** (6.3)
- **What**: Urgency requires justification. Never demand action without explaining why NOW.
- **When**: Every time you create urgency
- **Categories**: Capacity-based, Bonus-based, Pricing-based, Event-based
- **Formula**: State urgency + Give reason why + Tie to their benefit

**5. Good Order Form** (6.4)
- **What**: The order form is where you restate the entire offer and build final value
- **When**: Every purchase presentation
- **Key Principle**: "The order form is not just a form. It's the final restatement of the offer, the final value build, and the final risk reversal."
- **Structure**: Header + Full offer restatement + Risk reversal + CTA + Trust symbols

---

### TIER 3: SUPPORTING (4 frameworks)

**6. Clear Instruction (Lead Gen Close)** (6.1)
- **What**: For lead generation presentations, be explicit about the next step
- **When**: High-ticket offers, complex services, multi-step sales
- **Structure**: What to do + How to do it + What happens next
- **Examples**: "Call this number...", "Go to this website...", "Schedule appointment..."

**7. Alternate Choice (Lead Gen Close)** (6.1)
- **What**: Give them choice between two options, both of which move them forward
- **When**: Scheduling appointments, offering demos/consultations
- **Pattern**: "Tuesday or Thursday?" (not "Do you want to schedule?")
- **Why**: Binary yes/no gives easy out; alternate choice assumes forward movement

**8. Gift with Purchase + Toy in Box** (6.2)
- **What**: Immediate gratification matters. Give them SOMETHING right away.
- **When**: Physical products that ship, programs starting later, high-ticket services
- **Key Quote**: "Toy in the box. When you bought Cracker Jacks, you wanted the toy in the box."
- **Purpose**: Speed of gratification reduces buyer's remorse

**9. Ease of Buying / Terms / Payment Options** (6.4)
- **What**: Remove ALL friction from the buying process
- **When**: Every purchase presentation
- **Key Quote**: "Make buying as easy as humanly possible. Every obstacle you leave in place costs you sales."
- **Elements**: Multiple payment methods, payment plans, simple forms, trust symbols, mobile-friendly

## Kennedy's Core Close Principles

### The Six Non-Negotiables:

1. **Clarity Before Persuasion**
   - Clearly understood offer is non-negotiable
   - If confused, they won't buy

2. **Believed Urgency Only**
   - Scarcity only works if they believe it
   - Fake urgency destroys trust

3. **Risk Reversal Is Math**
   - "Risk reversal is all math. None of it is emotion."
   - Calculate worst case: refund rate × order value = cost
   - Don't make guarantees you'll be grumpy about honoring

4. **Speed of Gratification**
   - Give them SOMETHING immediately (toy in box)
   - Reduces buyer's remorse

5. **Ease Beats Clever**
   - Remove all friction from buying
   - Every obstacle costs sales

6. **Memorize the Pitch**
   - "If you're going to memorize anything, memorize the pitch."
   - Content can be winged, close must be nailed

- [ ] Does perceived value exceed price by 3x+? (Framework 3)
- [ ] Have you given reason why for urgency? (Framework 4)
- [ ] Does order form restate full offer? (Framework 5)
- [ ] Is next step instruction crystal clear? (Framework 6)

## The Kennedy Close Difference

**What Kennedy brings that others don't emphasize:**
- Believed scarcity (not real vs. fake, but believed vs. not believed)
- Risk reversal as math (remove emotion, calculate cost)
- Order form as sales tool (not just a form)
- Toy in box (speed of gratification)
- Clear instruction primacy (explicit beats implied)
- Reason why for urgency (justify the NOW)

**What Kennedy doesn't cover:**
- Specific psychological closes (see Brunson, Fladlien)
- The Stack methodology (see Brunson)
- Bonus presentation systems (see Fladlien)
- Trial closes throughout (see Brunson)

**Kennedy's philosophy:**
Clarity, believability, and ease beat cleverness and pressure every time.
