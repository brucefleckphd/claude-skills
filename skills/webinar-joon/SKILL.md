# Peng Joon Event Codex - Complete Methodology

## IMPORTANT: Silent Critique Workflow

**After generating any output with this skill, Claude MUST run the webinar-critic agent BEFORE presenting to user.**

```
1. Generate draft using this skill (user does not see)
2. Run webinar-critic agent on draft (user does not see)
3. Log critique findings to ~/.claude/agents/webinar-critic/logs/critique-log.md
4. Log to central system: ~/.claude/learning-system/logs/central-log.md
5. Apply all fixes from critique (user does not see)
6. Present ONLY the final polished output to user
```

**The user sees:** Polished final output only
**The user does NOT see:** Draft, critique, or fix process

The complete system for creating profitable, transformational live events and webinars. Built from 200+ events across 20+ countries, from $0 to multi-million dollar weekends.

## The Event Codex Philosophy

**Core Belief:** "Success in life and events is about showing up - but getting people to show up, serving them at the highest level, and creating lasting change requires a systematic approach across five critical pillars."

**Unique Approach:** Unlike other webinar methodologies focused purely on selling, Peng Joon's Event Codex is a complete BUSINESS SYSTEM that treats events as:
1. Lead generation engines (Pillar 1)
2. Relationship builders (Pillar 2)
3. Transformation vehicles (Pillar 3)
4. Revenue maximizers (Pillar 4)
5. Scalable assets (Pillar 5)

**The Event Codex integrates:** Facebook funnels + Live events + Online courses + Repurposing into one ecosystem.

---

## The 5 Pillars of The Event Codex

### Pillar 1: Selling the Tickets (8 frameworks)
**Focus:** Fill events profitably through Facebook ads and speaking gigs

**Component Skill:** `webinar-joon-funnel`

**Key Frameworks:**
- Four-Step Facebook Ad Progression (value → custom audiences → funnel → retargeting)
- Custom Audience Segmentation (every funnel step gets targeted ad)
- Objection Video Retargeting (3-5min videos, 4:1 ROI)
- Testimonial Cart Abandonment (only to warm traffic, never cold)
- Ideal Funnel Stack (Webinar → PLF → Free+Shipping)
- Getting Speaking Gigs (webinars → lunch sponsors → pay-to-speak → major organizers)

**Philosophy:** "The money is in retargeting (10-20:1 ROI), not cold traffic. Start relationships with value, not pitches."

---

### Pillar 2: Getting Them to Show Up (7 frameworks)
**Focus:** Maximize show-up rates and minimize refunds

**Component Skill:** `webinar-joon-delivery` (includes show-up strategies)

**Key Frameworks:**
- Micro-Commitments Strategy (physical gifts + pre-training + video sequences)
- Pre-Training Objection Crusher ('Start NOW so we can go deep when you arrive')
- Venue Walkthrough Video (day before, sets expectations, ensures punctuality)
- Refund Request Guilt Sequence (7 emails giving gifts, saves 20% of refunds)
- Hotel Negotiation (aim for 50% of first quote + free equipment)
- Event Flow Manual (33-page system so speaker focuses only on content)

**Philosophy:** "The money is in the backend, not ticket sales. More micro-commitments before event = higher show-up rate."

---

### Pillar 3: Fulfilling the Event (27 frameworks)
**Focus:** Serve audience at highest level through transformation, not just tactics

**Component Skills:**
- `webinar-joon-intro` (6 frameworks - opening patterns)
- `webinar-joon-content` (5 frameworks - teaching methodology)
- `webinar-joon-delivery` (11 frameworks - energy & logistics)

**Key Frameworks:**

*Opening (joon-intro):*
- Universal Open Question (100% yes to take control)
- Acknowledgment + WIIFM (address 'Did I make right decision?')
- Permission-Based Story Sharing (ask before telling origin story)
- Two-Hat Learning Mindset (student + observer)
- Four Components of Messaging (Successes, Struggles, Strengths, Beliefs - SSSP)

*Content (joon-content):*
- Four Layers Beyond Steps (Motivation, Fears, Choices, Aspirations)
- Motivation 3-Part System (Spark → Sustain → Amplify)
- Choices as Thought Leadership (teach hard choices, create divide)
- Five Content Layers (Theory → Tactics → **Transformation** → Transcendence)

*Delivery (joon-delivery):*
- State Change Energy Management (written exercises, partner shares, class shares)
- Mental State Change Through Questions (convert statements to questions)
- Event Context Setting (rules, breaks, punctuality from day 1)
- Ban Laptops (they kill energy)

**Philosophy:** "True transformation requires addressing motivation, fears, and beliefs - not just steps. Move from commodity teacher (tactics) to thought leader (transformation). People remember transformation, not tactics."

**Critical Insight:** "If you just give steps, you're replaceable by Google. Transformation is what separates thought leaders from commodity teachers."

---

### Pillar 4: Executing the Upsell (14 frameworks)
**Focus:** Convert attendees to high-ticket offers ethically and profitably

**Component Skills:**
- `webinar-joon-transition` (3 frameworks - seeding & positioning)
- `webinar-joon-close` (11 frameworks - upsell execution)

**Key Frameworks:**

*Transition (Seeding):*
- Seeding Through Content (introduce upsells as teaching examples in first hour)
- High-Ticket Price Marinade (reveal price EARLY, spend rest of event justifying)
- Hook-Story-Offer for Opportunity (sell the vehicle before the product)

*Close:*
- Done-With-You/Done-For-You Stack Building (maximize perceived value)
- Value Demonstration Through Team Videos (30-sec clips showing real cost)
- Bonus Marinade (build value during teaching, just reference at close)
- Table Rush 3-Step Progression (hand raise → stand → move to tables)
- Application Close for High-Ticket ($7K now, $16K if results in 12 months)
- Bonus Session Re-Close (buyers-only, reduces refunds, gets fence-sitters)
- Myron Golden Principles (persuasion vs convincing, moral obligation, cost of not knowing)
- Tony Robbins Anchoring (anchor states during teaching, trigger at close)

**Philosophy:** "A good close is the entire presentation, not just the last 10 minutes. If you served them at the highest level and answered limiting beliefs, the close is just mechanics."

**Peng's Truth:** "Speaking and closing are two completely different things. Great content speakers are everywhere. Closers are rare. That's what organizers care about."

---

### Pillar 5: Leveraging the Event (12 frameworks)
**Focus:** Turn one-time events into scalable, recurring assets

**Component Skill:** `webinar-joon-leverage`

**Key Frameworks:**
- Funnel Economics (know CAC and LTV - Sharks ask every time)
- Front-End Funnel Stack (free+shipping → free leads for webinar/event)
- Presentation-to-Product Repurposing (speak it → booklet → funnel)
- High-Converting Order Bump (actionable blueprint, 25-38% conversion)
- Thank You Page Webinar (Dean Holland method, 75-min training, $997 offer, 0.5% = +$5 ACV)
- Done-For-You Recurring as OTO2 (creates predictable revenue stream)
- Testimonial Acquisition Process (quality question formula, never had a 'no')
- Group Photo Boost (everyone comments → retargeting ad with real social proof)
- Comment Forms for Legal Protection (saved from 6-year-old refund request)
- Ultimate Testimonial (money-back offer live on stage, most powerful asset)
- Sizzle Reel Creation (speaking on stages = irreplaceable branding)

**Philosophy:** "The speaker business trap is the never-ending loop of speak-fulfill-speak. Without leverage and funnels, you're trading time for money forever. Build assets, not just events."

**Peng's Numbers:**
- Platform Closing: $54 ACV (can pay $38 per customer)
- Content Multiplier: $95 ACV (38% order bump conversion)
- Retargeting ROI: 10-20:1
- Collected 1000+ testimonials using quality question formula

## Unique Insights: What Makes Peng Joon Different

### 1. The 5 Pillar Business System (Not Just a Pitch)
Most webinar methodologies focus solely on "how to pitch from stage." Peng Joon treats events as a complete business ecosystem with 5 interdependent pillars.

### 2. Transformation Over Tactics
"If all you do is teach steps, you're a commodity replaceable by Google. True change requires addressing motivation, fears, beliefs, and choices."

**The 4 Layers Beyond Steps:**
- Motivation (spark, sustain, amplify)
- Fears (loss, outcome)
- Choices (teaching hard choices creates thought leadership)
- Aspirations (universal desires)

### 3. Retargeting is Where Money Is (10-20:1 ROI)
While others chase cold traffic, Peng focuses on segmented retargeting for every funnel step.

### 4. Bonus Marinade vs Explaining Bonuses at Close
Build bonus value during teaching (low resistance), just reference at close (don't re-explain). "Game changer most speakers haven't hacked."

### 5. High-Ticket Price Marinade (Weighing Scale)
For $10K+ offers, reveal price EARLY, spend rest of event justifying. Opposite of low-ticket.

### 6. Seeding Through Content (Not Pitching)
Introduce upsells casually as teaching examples in first hour. Establishes price point and value before resistance builds.

### 7. Application Close with Results-Based Payment
"$7K now. If you make $100K in 12 months, you pay $23K total on your integrity. Fair?"

### 8. Micro-Commitments for Show-Up
Physical gifts + pre-training + video sequences = dramatically higher show-up rates.

### 9. Leveraging Events as Assets
Speak presentation → Professional booklet → Free+shipping funnel → High ACV → Free leads for backend.

### 10. Myron Golden Integration
Persuasion vs convincing. Moral obligation to sell. Cost of not knowing ($1M - $120K = $880K paid to life). Let THEM do the math.
