## Framework Details

### 1. Funnel Economics Knowledge (ACV Math)
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Math:**
```
Track: Visitors → Emails → Purchases → OTO1 → OTO2 → OTO3
Calculate: Conversion rate at each step
Calculate: Average Cart Value (ACV) at each step
Know: Final ACV = how much you can pay for customer
```

**Key Insight:** Person who can pay most for customer always wins.

**Examples:**
- Platform Closing: $54 ACV - $10 COGS = can pay $44 per customer
- Content Multiplier: $95 ACV → Can scale aggressively

**The Two Numbers That Matter:**
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** What you pay to get someone
2. **Lifetime Value (LTV):** What they're worth to you

**Golden Rule:** LTV > CAC = you can scale. The bigger the gap, the faster you grow.

### 2. Front-End Funnel Stack for Events
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Strategy:**
Build free+shipping funnel with $50+ ACV → Leads for webinar become free → Webinar = 100% profit → Event = backend maximizer.

**The Stack:**
1. **Free+Shipping Offer:** Book/resource ($7.95 shipping)
2. **Order Bump:** Blueprint/checklist ($37-47)
3. **OTO1:** Thank you page webinar → $997+ offer
4. **OTO2:** Done-for-you recurring ($97-297/month)

**The Economics:**
- Target ACV: $50-95
- Ad cost: $20-40 per customer
- Result: Break even or profit on front-end
- Webinar becomes pure profit center

**Why This Works:**
Every webinar lead is free because front-end paid for acquisition. Now webinar sales are 100% margin.

### 3. Testimonial Acquisition Process
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Formula:**
1. **Ask:** "What was your biggest takeaway?"
2. **Listen:** Wait for sound bite moment
3. **Repeat back:** "So if I heard you right, this gave you [X]?"
4. **Ask permission:** "Would it be okay to repeat on camera? If you don't look good, we'll delete it."
5. **Record:** Capture their response

**Key Principles:**
- Never had anyone say no (1000+ testimonials)
- Quality of question determines quality of answer
- Fish for the sound bite - don't just turn camera on
- Permission removes pressure
- "We'll delete it" = safety net

**Setup:**
- Testimonial corner at end of event
- Simple backdrop
- Good lighting
- 30-60 second captures

**Result:** Professional testimonials without paid videographers.

---

### 4. Presentation-to-Product Repurposing
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Sequence:**
Live presentation → Transcribe → Design as professional booklet → Free+shipping funnel → Order bump → OTO stack

**Example (Platform Closing):**
- Delivered live as 45-minute talk
- Turned into 30-page designed booklet
- Became free+shipping offer ($7.95)
- Blueprint as order bump ($37)
- Video masterclass as OTO1 ($197)
- Done-for-you as OTO2 ($297/month)

**Why This Works:**
- You already created the content (sunk cost = zero)
- One presentation = multiple revenue streams
- Same content, different formats, different price points
- Leverages what you already know

**The Process:**
1. Record your best live presentation
2. Transcribe and edit for clarity
3. Hire designer to make it beautiful
4. Add order bump (blueprint/checklist)
5. Film yourself teaching it (OTO1)
6. Offer to do it for them (OTO2)

---

### 5. High-Converting Order Bump Formula
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Pattern:**
Create actionable companion piece (not more information) - blueprint, checklist, action plan.

**Characteristics of High-Converting Bumps:**
- **Actionable:** Not theory, not more teaching - STEPS
- **Complementary:** Makes main product easier to implement
- **Quick win:** Can use immediately
- **Visual:** PDF blueprint, not just text

**Price Point:** $37-47

**Target Conversion:** 25-38%

**Examples:**
- Book on closing → Blueprint with scripts
- Social media training → 30-day content calendar
- Funnel training → Funnel blueprint template

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't offer "bonus module" (more info they won't consume)
- Don't offer unrelated product
- Don't price too high (kills conversion)

**The Copy:**
"Wait! Before you go... want the BLUEPRINT that makes this 10x faster? Just $37 - check the box above."

---

### 6. Thank You Page Webinar (Dean Holland Method)
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Setup:**
After purchase, redirect to: "Your book takes 1-2 weeks to arrive. Want to start training NOW while you wait?"

**The Webinar:**
- 75-minute flip chart teaching
- High energy, high value
- Clear, compelling offer at end ($997+)
- Target conversion: 0.5-1%

**The Math:**
- 1000 buyers → 500 watch webinar (50% show rate)
- 5 sales at $997 = $4,985
- ACV increase: $5-20 per customer

**Why This Works:**
- They just bought = high intent state
- Waiting for delivery = dead time
- Free training = additional value
- Those who buy here are HYPER buyers

**Dean Holland's Results:**
Consistently adds $10-15 to ACV across thousands of customers.

**Key:** Must be GOOD webinar. Poor training damages trust.

### 7. Done-For-You Recurring as OTO2
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Three-Option Frame:**
1. **DIY:** What they just bought
2. **Hire someone else:** Expensive, risky, time-consuming
3. **Get MY team:** $97-297/month - we do it for you

**The Pitch:**
"You now have the system. Three ways to implement:
1. Do it yourself (that's what you bought)
2. Hire someone on Upwork ($500-2000, hope they're good)
3. Let my team do it ($197/month, guaranteed results)"

**Target Conversion:** 10-15%

**The Math:**
- 1000 customers
- 100-150 take recurring
- $19,700-$44,550/month recurring revenue
- From ONE product launch

**Examples:**
- Content creation → Done-for-you posting service
- SEO training → We do your SEO monthly
- Email course → We write your emails

**Key Principle:** Sell the RESULT, not the doing. People buy outcomes.

### 8. Group Photo Boost Strategy
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Process:**
1. End of event: "Everyone on stage for group photo!"
2. Take professional photo with everyone
3. Post to Facebook event group
4. **Critical:** "Comment below with your biggest takeaway!"
5. Hundreds of comments pour in
6. Screenshot the love
7. Use in retargeting ad

**The Ad:**
Image: Group photo with comment overlay
Copy: "Surely all these people can't be lying. Here's what they experienced..."

**Why This Works:**
- Social proof on steroids
- Their peers, not celebrities
- Real comments, real people
- Works ONLY on retargeting (warm traffic)

**Warning:**
Never run testimonials to cold traffic. They don't know who these people are. Only works for people who ALMOST bought.

---

### 9. Comment Forms for Legal Protection
**Tier:** 3 (Advanced)

**The Setup:**
End of event: "Help us improve! Write your feedback on this card."

**What to Ask:**
- What was your biggest takeaway?
- What exceeded your expectations?
- How would you rate this event? (1-10)
- Would you recommend to others?

**The Protection:**
When refund request comes months/years later, pull their form:

"On June 15th, you wrote: 'This was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. I made my first $5K in 3 days. Worth 10x what I paid.'

Are you saying that wasn't true?"

**Peng's Experience:**
"The more people you serve, the more crazy people you meet. These forms have saved me thousands in fraudulent refunds."

**Additional Benefit:**
Real written testimonials in customer's handwriting. Can photograph and use in marketing (with permission).

### 10. Ultimate Testimonial (Money-Back Live)
**Tier:** 3 (Advanced)

**The Ascending Question Sequence:**
(Only do this if event was AMAZING and energy is HIGH)

1. "Was this event pretty good?" (hands up)
2. "Was it BETTER than pretty good?" (more hands)
3. "Did it surpass ALL events you've attended?" (many hands)
4. "Did anyone make their first sale?" (some hands)
5. "What if I offered you 100% money back right now - would you take it?" (no hands)
6. "What if I TRIPLED your money back?" (still no hands)
7. "So you're saying this was worth minimum $500,000 to you? Stand up!" (many stand)

**Film the entire sequence.**

**Why This Works:**
- Ascending commitment and consistency
- Public declaration
- Social proof cascade
- Video captures the energy

**Warning:**
Only do this if:
- Event genuinely delivered massive value
- Energy in room is electric
- You have integrity (don't manipulate)

**Use Case:**
Ultimate proof piece for sales pages. "Here's what happened when I offered to triple their money back..."

### 11. Sizzle Reel and Marketing Images
**Tier:** 3 (Advanced)

**What to Capture:**
- Stage shots (you presenting, energy, teaching moments)
- Audience reactions (laughing, taking notes, aha moments)
- Table rush (people running to buy)
- Group photos (entire audience)
- Testimonial moments
- Networking/interaction

**The Sizzle Reel:**
60-90 second compilation:
- Fast cuts
- High energy music
- Key moments
- Testimonial sound bites
- Call to action

**Where to Use:**
- Website hero section
- Sales page proof
- Facebook retargeting ads
- Email campaigns
- Social media content
- Future event promotion

**Investment:**
Hire professional videographer for 2-day event: $1,500-3,000
ROI: Use footage for YEARS across all marketing

**Peng's Library:**
200+ events = massive asset library. Every sales page features real event footage.

### 12. Event Flow USB Stick Gift
**Tier:** 3 (Advanced)

**What's on the USB:**
- Complete event flow manual
- All checklists and templates
- Presentation slides
- Resource links
- Bonus trainings
- Swipe files

**The Presentation:**
Midway through event:
"Who would find it valuable to have everything we're covering - all the checklists, all the templates, all the resources - on a USB stick you can plug in and use immediately?"

(Hands go up)

"Normally we'd charge $97 for this. Today, EVERYONE gets one free!"

**The Investment:**
- USB sticks: $3-10 each (bulk)
- Pre-load content
- Custom branding

**The Psychology:**
- Build value first (people want it)
- Give it free (wow moment)
- Tangible gift (they hold it)
- Over-deliver on expectations

**Additional Benefit:**
They plug it in = digital breadcrumb trail back to your ecosystem (links to resources, membership areas, future offers).

**Peng's Note:**
"This $10 USB created $50,000+ in goodwill and word-of-mouth. People STILL talk about it years later."
