# Fladlien Close Frameworks

Complete framework set for the close section (35% of webinar)—the selling sequence that converts.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating the close section of your webinar
- Presenting offers, pricing, and bonuses
- Handling money and time objections
- Optimizing conversion in the pitch

**Critical:** Build your CLOSE FIRST, before content or intro!

## Frameworks Included (18)

### Master Systems (Ace)
- **E1. Close Sequence** - The sacred order: Offer → Price → Bonuses → Guarantee → Objections → Scarcity
- **E5. Price Anchor Cascade** - $100K → $25K → $10K → $4,997 ("ridiculous" reveal)
- **E18. Money/Time Objection Scripts** - 9 proven closes for two universal objections

### Core Frameworks (King)
- **E4. Component Presentation Formula** - Headline → Bullets → Future Pace → Proof (per component)
- **E8. Bonus Time Ratio** - Spend 2-3x MORE time on bonuses than offer
- **E11. Best-for-Last Principle** - Save strongest bonus for last
- **E14. Hand-Hold Close** - Literally guide through every checkout step

### Solid Frameworks (Queen)
- **E2. Offer Minimization Principle** - Offer = LEAST important, LEAST time
- **E6. Early Price Reveal** - Price in first 5 minutes of close
- **E10. Bonus Compounding Technique** - Reveal → Review all → Repeat differently
- **E16. Fully Informed Decision Frame** - Not yes/no, asking for informed decision

### Supporting Frameworks (Jack/10)
- **E3. Offer Flow** - Name/Tagline → One-Sentence Benefit → Components
- **E7. 26 Asks Principle** - Don't give up until you've asked 26 times
- **E9. Bonus Selection Criteria** - "Wow factor" OR "Thin but valuable"
- **E12. Objection-Countering Bonus** - Shape bonuses to counter resistance
- **E13. Open Loop Bonus** - "Two secret weapons I won't disclose here..."
- **E15. Guarantee Script** - "If you ain't happy, I ain't happy"
- **E17. Question Reframe** - "Not objections—questions needing answers"

## How to Use

1. **Master the Sequence** - Study E1 (Close Sequence) to understand the sacred order
2. **Present Offer** - Use E2-E4 (minimize time, maximize clarity)
3. **Reveal Price** - Use E5-E7 (anchor high, reveal early, ask repeatedly)
4. **Present Bonuses** - Use E8-E13 (spend 2-3x MORE time than offer!)
5. **Give Guarantee** - Use E15 (remove all risk)
6. **Handle Objections** - Use E16-E18 (reframe and script)
7. **Hand-Hold** - Use E14 (guide through checkout)

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Close Sequence (Master Framework)

**The sacred order (nine times out of ten, use this exact sequence):**

```
1. OFFER (3-5 min)      → What you're selling
   ↓
2. PRICE (3-5 min)      → What it costs (anchored and revealed)
   ↓
3. BONUSES (20-30 min)  → Why they should buy NOW (longest section!)
   ↓
4. GUARANTEE (2-3 min)  → Why there's no risk
   ↓
5. OBJECTIONS (10 min)  → Handle money/time resistance
   ↓
6. SCARCITY (woven)     → Why they must act now
```

**Total close time:** 30-35 minutes (35% of 90-minute webinar)

**Critical Insight:** Bonuses get 2-3x MORE time than offer. They're already "maybe"—bonuses create the excitement.

## The Three Critical Systems

### SYSTEM 1: The Offer Presentation (5-10 minutes total)

**E2. Offer Minimization** - Offer is LEAST important
- Spend 3-5 minutes maximum
- They don't buy features, they buy transformation
- Keep it simple and move to bonuses

**E3. Offer Flow** - Three-part structure
1. Name/Tagline (memorable, specific)
2. One-Sentence Benefit (transformation promised)
3. Components (what's included)

**E4. Component Presentation** - For each component
- Headline (benefit-driven)
- Bullets (3-5 specific sub-benefits)
- Future Pace (them using it successfully)
- Proof (screenshot, testimonial, demo)
- 20 seconds per slide maximum

---

### SYSTEM 2: The Price Presentation (5-10 minutes total)

**E5. Price Anchor Cascade** - Psychological pricing
1. Start astronomically high ($100,000)
2. Drop to industry high ($25,000)
3. Drop to competitors ($10,000)
4. Reveal "ridiculous" actual price ($4,997)

Each drop makes next price feel smaller.

**E6. Early Price Reveal** - Timing matters
- Reveal price in first 5 minutes of close
- Don't save it for end
- They need time to process and justify

**E7. 26 Asks Principle** - Persistence pays
- Don't give up after one ask
- Don't give up after five asks
- Ask 26 different ways throughout close
- Each ask: different angle, different reason

---

### SYSTEM 3: The Bonus System (20-30 minutes - MOST TIME!)

**E8. Bonus Time Ratio** - The golden rule
- Spend 2-3x MORE time on bonuses than on offer
- Offer presentation: 3-5 minutes
- Bonus presentation: 20-30 minutes
- Why: They're already "maybe" on offer—bonuses tip decision

**E9. Bonus Selection Criteria** - What qualifies
- "Wow factor" (high perceived value, exciting)
- OR "Thin but valuable" (small but solves specific problem)
- Not both required—either criterion works

**E10. Bonus Compounding Technique** - How to present
1. Reveal first bonus (full presentation)
2. Review ALL bonuses revealed so far
3. Reveal second bonus
4. Review ALL again (but frame differently)
5. Repeat until all revealed
6. Each review compounds perceived value

**E11. Best-for-Last Principle** - Sequencing
- Save strongest bonus for last
- Build to crescendo
- Last bonus creates final excitement peak

**E12. Objection-Countering Bonus** - Strategic selection
- Listen for objections during webinar
- Include bonuses that specifically counter them
- "I know some of you are thinking [objection]... that's why I'm including [bonus]"

**E13. Open Loop Bonus** - Mystery creation
- "Two secret weapons I won't disclose here..."
- "These are only revealed inside the program..."
- Creates curiosity gap, makes them need to buy to find out

## The Objection Handling System

**E16. Fully Informed Decision Frame**
- Not asking for yes/no
- Asking them to make a fully informed decision
- "I'm not asking you to say yes, I'm asking you to get all the information you need..."

**E17. Question Reframe**
- They're not objections
- They're questions that need to be answered
- "These aren't objections—they're important questions that deserve answers"

**E18. Money/Time Objection Scripts** - The two universal objections

**MONEY OBJECTIONS (9 scripts):**

1. **Life-Saving Operation Close**
   - "If your child needed a life-saving operation..."

2. **It Beats McDonald's Close**
   - "What's $4,997 compared to what you spend on..."

3. **Money or Excuses Close**
   - "You can make money or you can make excuses..."

4. **Old Habits Die Hard Close**
   - "Your old habits around money got you here..."

5. **When/Then Philosophy Destroyer**
   - "When I have more money, then I'll invest... doesn't work"

6. **Do Nothing or Do Something Close**
   - "Do nothing and stay where you are, or do something..."

7. **What Money is Good For Close**
   - "Money is only good for what you can exchange it for..."

8. **The Pricing Decision Close**
   - "I could have charged $10K... here's why I didn't"

9. **Nothing Special Close**
   - "There's nothing special about you that makes this work for others but not you"

**TIME OBJECTIONS (covered in same scripts, different angle)**
- Same psychological principles
- Different framing around time scarcity
- "Time you don't invest now = time lost later"

## The Hand-Hold Close (Final Step)

**E14. Hand-Hold Close** - Walk them through checkout

"Open your browser... Type this URL... You'll see a countdown timer... Scroll down... Click 'Add to Cart'... Enter your information... Click 'Complete Purchase'..."

**Why it works:**
- Removes friction
- Eliminates confusion
- Makes action feel inevitable
- Shows confidence in offer

## Core Close Principles

1. **Build close FIRST** - Before content, before intro
2. **Follow sacred sequence** - Offer → Price → Bonuses → Guarantee → Objections → Scarcity
3. **Bonuses beat offers** - 2-3x MORE time on bonuses
4. **Early price reveal** - In first 5 minutes of close
5. **Ask 26 times** - Don't give up early
6. **Hand-hold** - Guide through every step

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1:** Too much time on offer
- Violates Offer Minimization
- Should be 3-5 minutes maximum

**Mistake #2:** Rushing through bonuses
- Violates Bonus Time Ratio
- Should be 20-30 minutes (longest section!)

**Mistake #3:** Hiding the price
- Violates Early Price Reveal
- Creates suspicion and distrust

**Mistake #4:** Giving up too soon
- Violates 26 Asks Principle
- Ask repeatedly, different angles

**Mistake #5:** Not handling objections
- Money and time are universal
- Must address explicitly with scripts

## Validation Questions

**Before finalizing close:**
- Does this follow the Close Sequence? (E1)
- Am I spending 2-3x MORE on bonuses than offer? (E8)
- Is price revealed in first 5 minutes? (E6)
- Am I using Price Anchor Cascade? (E5)
- Do I have specific scripts for money/time objections? (E18)
- Do I hand-hold through checkout? (E14)
