# Deutsch Leads

David Deutsch lead frameworks. Use when writing or improving copy leads. Covers dual journey structure, resistance-free selling, market sophistication, and Deutsch's lead psychology.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing or improving copy leads
- Matching lead approach to market sophistication
- Reducing resistance and skepticism
- Creating emotional and intellectual journey

## Critical Lesson: Story-First for Stage 5 Markets

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** Opening with problem rehash before the story kills conversions.

When writing for sophisticated markets (Stage 4-5), DO NOT start with:
- "That folder on your computer..."
- "You've been lied to..."
- "Let me tell you what this means..."

These EXPLAIN problems the reader already knows. They're filler. They bore.

**THE FIX:** Open with your origin story. Put the reader IN THE SCENE.

```
WRONG (problem rehash):
"That folder on your computer? The one stuffed with courses you bought? It's worthless."

RIGHT (story-first):
"I'll never forget December 2024. 3am. My wife asleep upstairs. Me, staring at two windows on my computer screen..."
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Story hooks immediately (TV show test)
- Conflict creates tension
- Reader learns problem THROUGH story, not lecture
- Absolution pattern comes AFTER story, not before

**THE SEQUENCE:**
1. Story with conflict → 2. Breakthrough moment → 3. Result/proof → 4. THEN absolution ("It's not your fault")

This sequence consistently produces B+ or higher copy. Problem-first produces C+ or lower.
