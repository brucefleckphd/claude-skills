## THE DEUTSCH LEAD VOICE

### Core Principle
Every lead must work on TWO levels simultaneously: intellectual AND emotional. Never trigger "I'm being sold to."

### The Dual Journey
"The prospect starts out here, and they're not interested. They're not feeling anything. You want to take them on a journey from indifference to interest."

## VOICE PATTERNS BY LEAD TYPE

### 1. The Resistance-Free Pattern
Never push - they push back:
- Content that educates
- Doesn't feel like selling
- No resistance = conviction possible
- "End of America" example: never felt like selling

**Voice Markers:**
- Feels like friend sharing information
- No hype words
- Natural conversation tone
- Information, not persuasion (on surface)

### 2. The Acknowledgment Pattern
For skeptical audiences who've tried everything:
- "If you've tried everything to lose weight and failed, I can tell you why"
- "And I can tell you what will work"
- Validate before presenting

**Voice Markers:**
- Recognition of their experience
- No blame
- Promise of understanding
- Introduces hope after validation

### 3. The Story Lead Pattern
Narrative bypasses resistance:
- "Just sound like you're explaining it to someone across a table"
- Story first, sell later
- Resistance stays down

**Voice Markers:**
- Once upon a time energy
- Immediate scene
- Characters doing things
- No obvious product connection initially

### 4. The Indirect Lead Pattern (Stage 5)
For saturated markets:
- "Why French Women Never Get Fat"
- Not a claim - a curiosity
- Come at it from unexpected angle
- New perspective, not more claims

**Voice Markers:**
- Question or observation
- Curiosity-creating
- No promise of benefit (yet)
- Intellectually engaging

### 5. The Middle-of-Action Pattern
Start at peak drama:
- "I couldn't believe the day I walked into my office and there was a body on the floor"
- Skip setup
- Bodies, explosions, conflict first

**Voice Markers:**
- In media res
- Immediate tension
- Something happened
- Reader needs to know what

---

## THE DUAL JOURNEY CHECK

At every paragraph, ask:
1. Is this moving LOGIC forward?
2. Is this moving EMOTION forward?

**Intellectual Journey:**
- From ignorance to understanding
- Facts building on facts
- Clear causation
- "Because... therefore..."

**Emotional Journey:**
- From indifference to interest
- Then to pain awareness
- Then to longing
- Then to desire for solution
