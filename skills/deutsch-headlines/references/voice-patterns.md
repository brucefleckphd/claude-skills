## THE DEUTSCH HEADLINE VOICE

### Core Principle
Headlines don't need to be clever - they need to be INTERESTING. Grab attention, create curiosity, promise value.

### Quantity Over Quality
"Creative people don't have better ideas - they have MORE ideas. Write 100 headlines, 10% will be good."

## VOICE PATTERNS BY HEADLINE TYPE

### 1. The Opposite Pattern
Instead of the expected, say the unexpected:
- "Here's why you should NOT invest in gold"
- "How to lose money in the stock market"
- "Why diets make you fat"

### 2. The Fantasy Pattern
Start with what you WISH you could say:
- "Be as rich as Warren Buffett" → "How to invest like Warren Buffett"
- "Get a standing ovation every time" → leads to actual headline

### 3. The Crazy Attention Pattern
Lead with something interesting, not your product:
- "How to have the potency of a Zulu warrior"
- Think: banana ice cubes, explosions, grandmothers fighting

### 4. The Body on the Floor Pattern
Start at peak drama:
- "I couldn't believe the day I walked into my office and there was a body on the floor"
- Skip setup, start in action

### 5. The Mechanism Pattern (Stage 3+ markets)
HOW you do it is the hook:
- "Lose weight while you sleep"
- "Miracle pill from the Amazon"
- "The Harvard-endorsed technique that..."

### 6. The Big Idea Pattern
New perspective, not just a claim:
- "Why French women never get fat" (curiosity, not claim)
- Change how they THINK about the problem
