# Handle Objections

Transform "no" into "tell me more." This skill provides battle-tested responses to common objections while maintaining rapport and advancing the sale.

## When to Use This Skill

- Prospect raises price concerns
- "Not the right time" responses
- Competitive comparison questions
- Decision-maker access challenges
- Stalled deals needing reactivation

## Required Inputs

**Objection Context:**
- Exact objection stated by prospect
- Where in the sales process this occurred
- Prospect's role and likely concerns
- Your offering and price point
- Any previous objections from this prospect

**Additional Context:**
- Industry vertical
- Company size
- Known competitors they're considering

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Objection Type
Categorize the objection:
- **Price:** Too expensive, no budget, cheaper alternatives
- **Timing:** Not now, next quarter, too busy
- **Authority:** Need to check with boss/team
- **Trust:** Skepticism about results, unknown company
- **Need:** Don't see the problem, current solution works
- **Competition:** Considering alternatives, incumbent loyalty

### Step 2: Apply LAER Framework
- **Listen:** Acknowledge their concern genuinely
- **Acknowledge:** Show you understand (not agree)
- **Explore:** Ask clarifying question to uncover real objection
- **Respond:** Address the core concern with relevant response

### Step 3: Craft Response Options
Provide multiple response approaches:
- Direct response
- Question-based pivot
- Story/social proof response
- Risk reversal approach

### Step 4: Plan Next Step
Every response should lead to a concrete next action.

## Common Objection Responses

### Price Objections
- "I hear you on budget. Let me ask - if price weren't a factor, would this be the solution you'd choose?"
- "Totally understand. What would the cost of NOT solving this be over the next 12 months?"
- "What if we structured this differently? Tell me about your budget constraints."

### Timing Objections
- "Makes sense. What would need to change for the timing to be right?"
- "If you wait until Q2, what happens to [problem you discussed]?"
- "I'm curious - is it truly a timing issue, or is there something about the solution you're not sure about?"

### Authority Objections
- "Absolutely - who else needs to weigh in, and how can I help you make the case?"
- "What do you think they'll want to know that we haven't covered?"
- "Would it help if I joined a call with your team to answer questions directly?"

## Example

**Input:** "Prospect said 'Your solution sounds great but it's almost 30% more than CompetitorX. Hard to justify that.' - This is at the proposal stage."

**Output:**

# Objection Response Guide

**Objection Received:** "Your solution sounds great but it's almost 30% more than CompetitorX. Hard to justify that."
**Objection Category:** Price/Competition
**Stage:** Proposal

---

## Understanding the Objection

**Surface Concern:** Price is 30% higher than alternative
**Likely Real Concern:** Fear of looking bad if premium choice doesn't deliver; needs ammunition for internal approval
**Emotional Driver:** Risk aversion, job protection

---

## Response Options

### Option 1: Direct Response
"You're right - we're not the cheapest option. Here's why that matters: CompetitorX is built for [use case they're not optimized for]. Our clients typically see [specific ROI metric] within the first 90 days. Would that kind of return justify the difference?"

**Follow-up Question:** "What metrics would you need to see to make this a clear yes?"

---

### Option 2: Explore Before Responding
"Appreciate you being direct about that. Help me understand - if both solutions were priced the same, which would you choose?"

**If they say you:** "So the question is really about ROI, not price. Let's map out what the actual return would be..."
**If they say competitor:** "What specifically about their solution fits better?"

---

### Option 3: Social Proof Response
"Totally fair concern. [Similar Company] had the same hesitation. Six months in, their [metric] improved by [X%], which actually made us the cheaper option when you factor in results. Want me to connect you with their team?"

---

### Option 4: Risk Reversal
"What if we removed the risk? Let's do a 60-day pilot. If you don't see at least [X result], you can walk away - no questions asked. Does that work?"

## Recommended Next Step
"Let's schedule 30 minutes with your CFO/team. I'll bring a detailed ROI analysis comparing total cost of ownership, not just sticker price."
