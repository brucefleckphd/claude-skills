# Joon Introduction Frameworks

Peng Joon's systematic approach to starting presentations that establish control, create yes-momentum, and answer the audience's critical first question: "Did I make the right decision showing up?"

## When to Use This Skill

- Crafting webinar or event introductions (first 5-15 minutes)
- Opening any presentation to establish rapport quickly
- Creating audience engagement from the start
- Building yes-momentum for later asks
- Positioning your origin story effectively
- Teaching audiences meta-learning (two-hat approach)

## Core Philosophy: Control Through Questions

"The person asking the questions is in control. It's why lawyers ask questions, why judges ask questions in a court of law. If you can get your audience to say yes at the start, they're going to be a lot more inclined to say yes at the end."

## Frameworks Included (6)

### Tier 1 (Foundational)
1. **Universal Open Question Pattern** - Start with 100% yes question to establish control
2. **Acknowledgment and WIIFM Opening Structure** - Thank them, promise value, answer objections
3. **Permission-Based Story Sharing** - Ask permission before origin story for micro-commitment
4. **Four Components of Messaging (SSSP)** - Successes, Struggles, Strengths, Beliefs framework

### Tier 2 (Intermediate)
5. **Event Context and Rules Setting** - Ground rules for 50+ person events to control energy

### Tier 3 (Advanced)
6. **Two-Hat Learning Mindset** - Teach observers to analyze WHY you do what you do

## Framework Details

### 1. Universal Open Question Pattern

**Pattern:** Open every presentation with a question you KNOW 100% of audience will say yes to.

**Steps:**
1. Open with universal question guaranteed to get 100% yes
2. Examples: "How many want more reach and impact?" "How many here have busy lives?"
3. Recognize: Person asking questions is in control (like lawyers/judges in court)
4. Get audience saying yes from the start
5. If they say yes at start, more inclined to say yes at end

**Why it works:**
- Question-asker controls the conversation
- Yes-momentum is real psychological effect
- Universal question enrolls entire audience
- Builds habit of saying yes to you

**When to use:** First 60 seconds of any presentation, webinar, or event.

**Examples:**
- "How many want more reach and impact in your lives?" (100% yes)
- Infomercial: "Have you ever woke up in the morning, got out of bed, feeling tired?" (3 questions in 1, all yes)

**Quote:** "It is said that if you can get your audience to say yes at the start, they're going to be a lot more inclined to say yes at the end."

### 2. Acknowledgment and WIIFM Opening Structure

**Pattern:** After universal question, acknowledge their time sacrifice and answer "What's in it for me?"

**Steps:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "Thank you for being here, sacrificing your time"
2. **Promise:** "I will do everything in my power to make it worth your time"
3. **Answer objection:** Address their internal question "Did I make right decision showing up?"
4. **State WIIFM:** "Here's what you'll discover" (use 'discover' not 'learn')
5. **Present at least 3 things** they'll discover

**Why it works:**
- Audience is skeptical at start: "Did I make right decision?"
- Must acknowledge their time sacrifice explicitly
- Word choice matters: 'discover' not 'learn' (learning is painful)
- WIIFM must be clear and compelling
- People don't want to learn, they want to discover

**When to use:** First 5 minutes of any webinar, presentation, or event.

**Examples:**
- "Thank you for being here. I will do everything in my power to make it worth your time."
- "Here's what you'll DISCOVER (not learn) in this event"

**Quote:** "Learning is a dirty word. People don't want to learn. Learning sounds like a really painful process. People want to discover."

### 3. Permission-Based Story Sharing

**Pattern:** Ask permission before telling your story to increase engagement and buy-in.

**Steps:**
1. After stating WIIFM, ask: "Would it be okay if I shared my story?"
2. Wait for response (usually yes)
3. Tell origin story with successes AND struggles
4. Always connect successes back to them: "Here's what I learned that will help YOU"
5. Zone-out happens when you dwell on successes without connecting to them

**Why it works:**
- Asking permission creates micro-commitment
- Makes them active participant, not passive listener
- Successes without connection to audience = zone out
- Every success must link to "what's in it for them"

**When to use:** Before any extended personal story or origin story.

**Examples:**
- "Would it be okay if I shared my background and story with you?"
- "I did a million dollar launch. I'm going to show you what I learned from this launch SO YOU can do it too."

**Quote:** "Every time you talk about your successes, connect it with your struggles and make it about them. If you don't connect your successes back to them, that's when they zone out."

### 4. Four Components of Messaging (SSSP)

**Framework for crafting authentic personal brand messaging:** Successes, Struggles, Strengths, and Beliefs.

**The Four Components:**

1. **Successes** - Build credibility ("Why should I listen to you?")
2. **Struggles** - Build rapport ("You're human like me")
3. **Strengths** - Direct result of struggles and successes
4. **Beliefs** - About life, business, customers (differentiates thought leaders)

**Steps:**
1. Document your Successes (builds credibility)
2. Share your Struggles (builds rapport - most powerful part)
3. Identify your Strengths (emerged from struggles and successes)
4. Articulate your Beliefs (about life, business, customers)
5. Weave all four into origin story, Facebook content, emails, presentations

**Why it works:**
- Successes alone make you seem superhuman and unreachable
- Struggles make you relatable and inspire belief "I can do it too"
- Most powerful part is struggles, not successes
- Every success connected back to them creates learning moment
- Beliefs differentiate you as a thought leader vs commodity teacher

**When to use:** Creating origin stories, onboarding videos, social media content, event presentations.

**Examples:**
- Tony Robbins washing dishes in bathtub story (told repeatedly)
- Peng Joon "What I Believe" video - 4 minutes covering all four components

**Quote:** "The struggles is what makes you human. If I talked about how great I am at programming, design, and copywriting, people say 'of course you can do it, you are a superhuman.' But when I share I'm not a programmer and I struggle with tech, that gives them hope."

### 5. Event Context and Rules Setting

**For 50+ person events:** Establish ground rules at start to control environment and manage energy.

**Steps:**
1. **Set start song** - Condition room that song means "be seated before it ends"
2. **Display countdown timer** for breaks
3. **Explain breaks are NOT Q&A:** "Needs of many outweigh needs of one"
4. **Enforce punctuality rules** (start on time every session)
5. **Request phones on silent**
6. **Explain:** "Starting late is disrespectful to the 99 others who showed up on time"

**Why it works:**
- Context-setting prevents overwhelm
- Without rules, people monopolize breaks for personal questions
- Punctuality respect is crucial for smooth operation
- 10-person events can skip this, but 100+ person events require it
- Always start on time to train audience

**When to use:** At the very beginning of any multi-session event with 50+ people.

**Examples:**
- "You Get What You Give" song = be seated before it ends
- "If I gave 5 minutes to each of 100 people, that's 500 minutes = 2 days"

**Quote:** "If you don't enforce those rules at the start, doing an event of 100-200 people without having those things in place, you will get overwhelmed."

### 6. Two-Hat Learning Mindset

**Advanced technique:** Teach audience to wear two hats - student learning content AND observer analyzing structure and psychology.

**Steps:**
1. Tell audience: "Put on two hats throughout this event"
2. **Hat 1: Student** - Learning the content
3. **Hat 2: Observer** - Constantly asking "Why did he just do what he did?"
4. Encourage them to notice structure, frameworks, psychology behind delivery
5. This meta-awareness is more powerful than content alone

**Why it works:**
- Most students only wear student hat
- Observer hat teaches presentation craft itself
- Understanding "why" is more valuable than "what"
- Creates deeper engagement and retention
- Teaches them to become better presenters/teachers themselves

**When to use:** For advanced audiences who want to learn presentation/teaching itself.

**Examples:**
- "Why did I just play that video when you already signed up?" (Answer: Re-selling decision)
- "Notice how I structured those questions to build yes-momentum"

**Quote:** "What I want you to do is put on two hats. The second hat would be to constantly ask yourself, why did Peng Joon just did what he did? To understand the structure and framework because there's a reason for it."

3. **Struggles are most powerful** - Don't skip this in favor of successes
4. **Get permission before story** - Creates micro-commitment
5. **Set rules for 50+ person events** - Or you'll get overwhelmed
6. **Connect every success back to them** - Prevents zone-out
