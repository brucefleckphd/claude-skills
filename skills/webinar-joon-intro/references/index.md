# Joon Introduction Frameworks - Quick Reference

## 6 Frameworks for Opening Presentations

### Tier 1 - Foundational (4)

1. **Universal Open Question Pattern**
   - Start with question 100% will say yes to
   - Examples: "How many want more reach and impact?"
   - Person asking questions = in control

2. **Acknowledgment and WIIFM Opening Structure**
   - Acknowledge: Thank them for time sacrifice
   - Promise: Make it worth their time
   - WIIFM: "Here's what you'll discover" (not "learn")

3. **Permission-Based Story Sharing**
   - Ask: "Would it be okay if I shared my story?"
   - Creates micro-commitment
   - Always connect successes back to them

4. **Four Components of Messaging (SSSP)**
   - Successes (credibility)
   - Struggles (rapport - most powerful)
   - Strengths (result of above)
   - Beliefs (thought leadership differentiator)

### Tier 2 - Intermediate (1)

5. **Event Context and Rules Setting**
   - Start song conditioning
   - Countdown timers for breaks
   - Breaks ≠ Q&A
   - Start on time always
   - For 50+ person events

### Tier 3 - Advanced (1)

6. **Two-Hat Learning Mindset**
   - Hat 1: Student (what)
   - Hat 2: Observer (why)
   - Teaches presentation craft itself
   - For advanced audiences

## Key Principles

- **Questions = Control** (lawyers, judges use this)
- **Yes-momentum is real** (start → end)
- **"Discover" not "Learn"** (word choice matters)
- **Struggles > Successes** (creates hope)
- **Connect to them** (prevents zone-out)

---

## Critical Don'ts

- Don't skip acknowledgment (they're skeptical)
- Don't say "learn" (use "discover")
- Don't tell successes without struggles
- Don't share story without permission
- Don't skip rules for 100+ person events
- Don't talk about yourself without connecting to them
