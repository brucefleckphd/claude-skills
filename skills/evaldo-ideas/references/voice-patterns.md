## THE EVALDO APPROACH TO IDEAS

### Core Principle
Ideas don't come from inspiration - they come from SYSTEMS. The best idea is worthless if it doesn't pass the Three Box test.

### The Idea Mindset
- Ideas are plentiful, good ideas are rare
- Test before investing time
- The mechanism is the secret
- Different beats better

## LANGUAGE FOR IDEAS

### When Presenting a Mechanism

**Good (Specific + Intriguing):**
- "This little-known [specific thing]..."
- "A [number]-step process discovered by..."
- "The [adjective] technique that..."
- "What [authority] calls 'the [name]'..."

**Avoid (Vague + Generic):**
- "A new way to..."
- "The secret to..."
- "How to easily..."
- "Finally, a solution..."

### When Contrasting with Competition

**Evaldo Style:**
- "While everyone else focuses on X, this does Y..."
- "The problem with [common approach] is..."
- "What [they] won't tell you..."
- "You've been told X. The truth is Y..."

## THE MECHANISM VOICE

### How Evaldo Names Mechanisms

**Strong Mechanism Names:**
- Use specific numbers: "The 3-Minute..."
- Use origin: "The Harvard..."
- Use discoverer: "Dr. Smith's..."
- Use metaphor: "The Domino..."

**Examples from Source:**
- "The 16-Word Sales Letter"
- "The Croc Brain Filters"
- "The Three Box Test"
- "The Stockholm Shoe Method"

### How Evaldo Explains Mechanisms

Keep it SIMPLE:
- One clear concept
- Analogy or metaphor
- "It works like..."
- "Think of it as..."
- "Here's why this matters..."

## IDEA DEVELOPMENT VOICE

### The 10 Questions Tone

When developing ideas, be:
- **Direct**: "The opportunity is..."
- **Specific**: "You'll see X result in Y timeframe"
- **Confident**: "This works because..."
- **Honest**: "If this isn't right for you..."

### Testing Ideas (Internal Voice)

Ask yourself:
- "Would I stop scrolling for this?"
- "Can I explain this in one sentence?"
- "Have I seen this exact angle before?"
- "Does this make me FEEL something?"

## EXAMPLES FROM EVALDO'S WORK

### Strong Idea Expression:
> "Most copywriters write headlines. Winners write open loops that torture
> the brain until they're closed. Here's how to create that irresistible
> pull..."

### Weak Idea Expression (Avoid):
> "Learn effective headline writing techniques that can help improve
> your conversion rates..."

### The Difference:
The first creates tension and specificity.
The second is generic and forgettable.
