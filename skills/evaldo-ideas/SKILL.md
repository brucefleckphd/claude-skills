# Evaldo Ideas

Evaldo Albuquerque's idea generation frameworks. The core of any promotion is the BIG IDEA - and Evaldo has a systematic approach to generating ideas that pass the Three Box test.

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting a new promotion from scratch
- Current idea isn't working
- Need a fresh angle on familiar product
- Researching competitor approaches
- Developing your unique mechanism

## The Three Ways to Generate Ideas

### 1. The New Mechanism Approach
Find a new mechanism (the HOW) for an existing desire. People are tired of the same promises. Give them a NEW way to achieve the same goal.

### 2. The Major Developments Approach
Track industry developments - regulations, research, events. What's happening NOW that changes everything? Timeliness creates urgency.

### 3. The Stockholm Shoe Method
Study competitors obsessively. Not to copy, but to find gaps. What hasn't been said? What angle is missing? What's the opposite of what everyone else is doing?

## Frameworks Included (6)

- ideas-new-mechanism
- ideas-major-developments
- ideas-stockholm-shoe
- ideas-idea-sources
- ideas-10-questions-brainstorm
- ideas-competitor-analysis

## How to Use

1. **Start with research** - Use the three approaches to generate multiple ideas
2. **Apply Three Box Check** - Filter through Emotional + Simple + New
3. **Develop the winner** - Turn the best idea into your One Belief
4. **Build the mechanism** - Make it proprietary and unique

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for a categorized list of all frameworks with one-line descriptions.

## Evaldo's Idea Philosophy

- **Most ideas fail the filters** - That's fine, generate more
- **New mechanism beats new promise** - Same desire, new way
- **Timing matters** - What's happening NOW in the industry?
- **Study competitors** - Not to copy, to find the gap
