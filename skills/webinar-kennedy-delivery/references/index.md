## Framework Clusters

### 8.1 Physical Environment Control (4 sub-frameworks)

Control the physical room to maximize sales and prevent early exits.

| Sub-Framework | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Block Easy Exit with Product Tables | Strategic placement to create buying friction | Physical room selling |
| Strong Expectations Conveyed | Pre-set behavior and sales expectations | Any presentation format |
| Stampede Creation | Visible social proof of buying | Physical events, webinars with stats |
| Second Bite at Apple | Allow decision time during break | Long presentations, high-ticket |

**Key Insight**: Environment is strategic, not accidental. Every element should make buying easier and leaving harder.

---

### 8.2 Video/Technical Production (5 sub-frameworks)

TV-quality production standards for recorded presentations.

| Sub-Framework | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Format Changes | Variety through angles/styles | Any video presentation |
| Set Building vs. Green Screen | Choose production approach | Pre-production planning |
| B-Roll and Cover Shots | Visual variety, editing flexibility | All video production |
| Product Beauty Shots | Glamorous product display | Selling physical products |
| Post-Production Priority | Where real selling happens | After filming complete |

**Key Insight**: "You're doing television, not recording an event." Production quality signals product quality.

---

### 8.3 Presenter Tells to Avoid (6 sub-frameworks)

Behavioral mistakes that telegraph selling and kill credibility.

| Tell | What It Is | The Fix |
|------|------------|---------|
| Physiological Change | Energy/tone shift content → commercial | Same energy throughout |
| Any Hint of Apology | Apologizing for selling | Reframe: offer = value delivery |
| Self-Disparaging Humor | Jokes about "now comes the pitch" | Treat pitch with same respect |
| Disrespectful Product Handling | Tossing, fumbling product | QVC standard: reverence |
| Confusion/Fumbling | Uncertain about offer details | Memorize pitch cold |
| Hurrying the Pitch | Rushing through close | Slow down, protect close time |

**Key Insight**: Your discomfort makes them uncomfortable. If you don't believe in the pitch, why should they?

## Kennedy's Delivery Principles

### The Big 5:

1. **"You're on television, not on stage"**
   - Camera angles matter
   - Product handling matters
   - Production quality signals value

2. **"Post-production is where everything happens"**
   - Shoot more footage than you need
   - B-roll saves edits
   - You can't fix what you didn't shoot

3. **"Never hurt the pitch by hurrying it"**
   - Close gets MORE time than content
   - If running over, cut content, not close
   - Slow down during selling moments

4. **"If selling product, have product THERE"**
   - Physical product beats digital description
   - Stack it, show it, handle it
   - Tangibility creates value perception

5. **"Make buying easy, leaving hard"**
   - Environment controls conversion
   - Visible stampede triggers herd behavior
   - Sales prevention department is real

## Quick Decision Trees

### Physical Room Setup?
```
Do you have physical product?
├─ YES → Product tables near exits, stack high, create visibility
└─ NO → Still create buying area, show digital proof, staff ready

Can audience leave easily?
├─ YES → Strong open, stampede visibility, second bite structure
└─ NO → Less urgency needed, but still set expectations
```

### Video Production?
```
Budget available?
├─ HIGH → Physical set, multiple cameras, extensive B-roll
├─ MEDIUM → Physical set or quality green screen, limited B-roll
└─ LOW → Single camera, green screen, focus on presenter training

Selling physical product?
├─ YES → MUST have product beauty shots, handle on camera
└─ NO → Can use graphics/visuals instead
```

### Presenter Training?
```
What's the #1 priority?
└─ Memorize the pitch (even if nothing else)

What's the #2 priority?
└─ Eliminate physiological change (same energy throughout)

What's the #3 priority?
└─ Remove apologetic language (never say sorry for selling)
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: The Infomercial Standard

Kennedy's background in infomercials shows up throughout:

```
INFOMERCIAL TACTICS → GROUP SELLING APPLICATION:

Product rotation on camera
└─ Rotate physical product toward camera, show all angles

Multiple format changes
└─ Direct camera, interview, demo every 8-12 minutes

Visible social proof
└─ Real-time buyer ticker, countdown, testimonials

Call to action clarity
└─ Explicit instructions, alternate choice, ease of buying

Post-production polish
└─ Remove all fumbles, optimize pacing, add B-roll
```

### Pattern: The QVC Product Handling

How to handle product on camera:

```
QVC JEWELRY STANDARD:
1. Hold toward camera (not toward self)
2. Rotate slowly (show all angles)
3. Point to details (features visible)
4. Handle with reverence (it's precious)
5. Admire it yourself (model the desire)

YOUR PRODUCT:
└─ Apply same standard regardless of what you sell
```

### Pattern: The Sales Prevention Department

Kennedy's awareness of buying friction:

```
WHERE SALES GET KILLED:

PHYSICAL ROOM:
├─ Hard to find sales area
├─ Long lines → people leave
├─ Confusing order forms
├─ Staff doesn't know process
└─ Product out of stock/invisible

VIDEO/ONLINE:
├─ Order link doesn't work
├─ Payment processor down
├─ Too many form fields
├─ Unclear what they're buying
└─ No confirmation/receipt

PRESENTER:
├─ Apologizes for selling
├─ Fumbles the details
├─ Rushes the pitch
├─ Disrespects the product
└─ Energy drops during close
```

Fix: Test the buying path yourself. Remove every friction point you can.

## Integration with Other Kennedy Skills

### Full Kennedy Delivery Workflow:

```
1. ARCHITECTURE (webinar-kennedy-architecture)
   └─ Choose media format, allocate time boxes

2. INTRO (webinar-kennedy-intro)
   └─ Stop checkout, establish who/why

3. CONTENT (webinar-kennedy-content)
   └─ Build commitment, create emotion

4. TRANSITION (webinar-kennedy-transition)
   └─ Bridge from teaching to selling

5. CLOSE (webinar-kennedy-close)
   └─ Present offer, handle objections, CTA

6. DELIVERY (THIS SKILL)
   └─ Execute with proper environment, production, behavior
```

**Delivery isn't last chronologically** (you plan it first), but it's shown last because it's how you IMPLEMENT everything else.

## Quotes Worth Memorizing

> "You're on television. You're not on stage. Therefore, the camera. You don't take the product and do this. You do this. You're on camera. You're doing TV."

> "All your great work is going to be done in post. Post-production is where everything happens, and you can't have enough footage."

> "The worst version of it is the person who delivers content content content content content and then they sort of physiologically change and now they deliver a commercial."

> "If you will sell more product if you have the product piled up there. Just as you will book more appointments if you have something piled up that they get to take home with them."

> "Never hurt the pitch by hurrying it. If you're going to short anything, short the content."
