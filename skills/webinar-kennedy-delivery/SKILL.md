# Kennedy Delivery Frameworks

Dan Kennedy's technical and tactical delivery guidance - from physical room control to video production to presenter behavior. Based on decades of infomercial and stage selling experience.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up physical room for maximum sales conversion
- Recording or filming presentations for webcast/DVD
- Avoiding common presenter mistakes that kill sales
- Creating professional video assets that sell
- Managing the sales environment (live or recorded)
- Training presenters on what NOT to do

## Core Philosophy

> "You're on television. You're not on stage. Therefore, the camera. You don't take the product and do this. You do this. You're on camera. You're doing TV."

Kennedy's delivery frameworks come from both worlds: decades of physical room selling at major events, and extensive infomercial/video production experience. He brings TV production standards to group selling presentations.

---

## Frameworks Included (3 Clusters)

### 8.1 Physical Environment Control
How to set up and manage a physical room to maximize sales and prevent walkouts.

### 8.2 Video/Technical Production
Format choices, production techniques, and post-production priorities for recorded presentations.

### 8.3 Presenter Tells to Avoid
Behavioral mistakes that telegraph you're selling and destroy credibility.

---

## FRAMEWORK CLUSTER 8.1: Physical Environment Control

**Category**: 8.1 - Room Management & Logistics
**Principle**: The physical environment should make buying easy and leaving hard.

### The Physical Room Arsenal

Kennedy approaches physical room setup like a direct marketer: control every variable that affects conversion.

**Sub-Framework 1: Block Easy Exit with Product Tables**

**What It Is**:
Strategic placement of product/fulfillment tables to create physical barriers to leaving.

**Kennedy's Tactic**:
> "If you will sell more product if you have the product piled up there. Just as you will book more appointments if you have something piled up that they get to take home with them."

**How It Works**:
1. Place product tables near exits (forces walk-by)
2. Stack product visibly (creates social proof)
3. Position staff to intercept (not block, but engage)
4. Create "come back after" pathway for second bite

**When to Use**:
- Any physical room selling
- When you have actual product to display
- When you want to create stampede visibility
- When controlling the exit flow matters

**Why It Matters**:
People who see others buying are more likely to buy. Physical product creates tangibility that digital delivery can't match.

---

**Sub-Framework 2: Strong Expectations Conveyed**

**What It Is**:
Pre-presentation messaging that sets behavior expectations for the room.

**The Expectation Categories**:
```
TIME EXPECTATION:
├── How long presentation will run
├── When breaks will occur
└── When they can leave (if at all)

BEHAVIOR EXPECTATION:
├── Phones off/away
├── Laptop behavior (allowed or not)
├── Questions (when/how)
└── Note-taking policy

SALES EXPECTATION:
├── You will be pitched
├── Limited quantity/time
├── Order process explained
└── What to bring to back table
```

**Kennedy's Insight**:
Don't surprise them with a pitch. They should know coming in this is a sales environment. Better to have fewer people who know what they're getting into than more people who feel ambushed.

**How to Implement**:
1. State expectations in promotional copy
2. Restate at beginning of presentation
3. Give specific instructions ("Forms will be passed out at minute 78...")
4. Make the ask unapologetic

---

**Sub-Framework 3: Stampede Creation**

**What It Is**:
Visible social proof of others buying that triggers herd behavior.

**Kennedy's Physical Room Advantages**:
```
WHAT THEY SEE:
├── Lines forming at back tables
├── People filling out forms
├── Product being handed over
├── Staff handling boxes
└── Others making decisions

WHAT THIS TRIGGERS:
├── FOMO (I'm missing out)
├── Social validation (if they're buying...)
├── Urgency (limited quantity real)
└── De-risking (all these people can't be wrong)
```

**How to Maximize**:
1. **Don't hide it**: Make the sales area visible from seats
2. **Show movement**: Staff actively fulfilling orders
3. **Create lines**: Even if you could serve faster, a line looks good
4. **Announce it**: "We've already filled 47 of the 100 slots..."
5. **Product depletion**: Visibly diminishing product stack

**When You Can't See It (Webcast)**:
- Real-time buyer ticker
- Names/cities of buyers
- Countdown of available slots
- Live stats update

**Why It Works**:
Humans are herd animals. We look to others to validate decisions, especially purchases.

---

**Sub-Framework 4: Second Bite at Apple**

**What It Is**:
Allowing people to leave to "think about it" and return during a buying break.

**The Structure**:
```
FIRST CLOSE:
├── Make the pitch
├── Call to action
└── Some buy immediately

BREAK PERIOD:
├── "We'll take a 15-minute break"
├── "Product tables will be open"
├── "Come back, we continue at..."
└── Allow procrastinators to decide

SECOND CLOSE (after break):
├── Acknowledge new buyers during break
├── Restate offer briefly
├── Final urgency push
└── Close doors on offer
```

**Kennedy's Example**:
At Peter Lowe events, some speakers would pitch, take a break, let people buy during break, then come back and do final push. People who weren't ready during pitch had time to process and see others buying.

**When to Use**:
- Presentations over 90 minutes
- High-ticket offers (people need time)
- When you have physical product/staff on-site
- When you can afford the time

**Why It Works**:
Some people need to see others buy first. The break gives them permission to think, but the stampede during break pushes them over the edge.

---

## FRAMEWORK CLUSTER 8.2: Video/Technical Production

**Category**: 8.2 - Recording & Post-Production
**Principle**: You're making television, not recording a speech. Production quality matters.

### Kennedy's TV Production Standards

Kennedy brings infomercial-level production thinking to webinar/video presentations.

**Sub-Framework 1: Format Changes**

**What It Is**:
Varying camera angles, settings, and presentation styles to maintain attention.

**The Format Options**:
```
DIRECT-TO-CAMERA:
├── Presenter speaking directly to viewer
├── Most intimate, builds connection
├── Best for: Authority, credibility, personal story
└── Requires: Teleprompter or strong memorization

INTERVIEW FORMAT:
├── Host interviews expert
├── Easier for presenter (conversational)
├── Best for: Proof, Q&A, objection handling
└── Requires: Skilled interviewer

PANEL DISCUSSION:
├── Multiple experts, moderated
├── Social proof through agreement
├── Best for: Complex topics, varied proof
└── Requires: Tight moderation

POWERPOINT/SLIDES:
├── Presenter + visual support
├── Good for teaching/demo
├── Best for: Process explanation, before/after
└── Requires: Clean slide design

DEMONSTRATION:
├── Show product/process in action
├── Proof through visibility
├── Best for: Tangible products, process
└── Requires: Good lighting, close-ups
```

**Kennedy's Principle**:
> "You're on television. You're not on stage."

This means: camera angles matter, lighting matters, set matters. You're not recording an event - you're creating a TV show.

**How to Use**:
1. Plan format changes every 8-12 minutes
2. Match format to content purpose (teaching = slides, proof = interview)
3. Rehearse transitions between formats
4. Maintain consistent energy across formats

---

**Sub-Framework 2: Set Building vs. Green Screen**

**What It Is**:
Choosing between physical set design and green screen backgrounds.

**The Decision Matrix**:
```
PHYSICAL SET (Kennedy's preference):
├── Looks more real/tangible
├── Props can be held/used
├── Product can be displayed
├── Depth and dimension visible
└── More expensive/complex

GREEN SCREEN:
├── Infinite background flexibility
├── Lower production cost
├── Can look cheap if done badly
├── No physical props
└── Faster to change scenes
```

**Kennedy's Guidance**:
If you're selling a physical product, have a physical set with product visible. Don't fake it with green screen. The tangibility matters.

**When Physical Set Matters Most**:
- Selling actual product (show it, pile it up)
- Demonstrating process (need real props)
- Building authority (office/library = credible)
- Long-form content (green screen fatigue is real)

**When Green Screen Works**:
- Pure information product
- Need multiple "locations" quickly
- Budget constrained
- Content will be heavily edited anyway

---

**Sub-Framework 3: B-Roll and Cover Shots**

**What It Is**:
Additional footage shot to use in editing for visual variety and covering cuts.

**What to Capture**:
```
B-ROLL CATEGORIES:
├── Product beauty shots (product from multiple angles)
├── Process demonstration (hands using product)
├── Lifestyle shots (product in use, context)
├── Testimonial subjects (customers talking)
├── Environmental shots (location, office, facility)
└── Cutaway shots (hands, audience, details)

COVER SHOTS (to hide edit cuts):
├── Close-up of product
├── Hands gesturing
├── Audience reaction
├── Visual aid/chart
└── Presenter from different angle
```

**Kennedy's Rule**:
> "All your great work is going to be done in post. Post-production is where everything happens, and you can't have enough footage."

**How to Execute**:
1. **Shoot more than you need**: Get every angle
2. **Dedicated B-roll time**: Don't try to grab it while presenting
3. **Match lighting/color**: B-roll must blend with main footage
4. **Multiple takes**: At least 3 versions of each shot
5. **Catalog it**: Label/organize so you can find it in editing

**Why It Matters**:
You can't fix in post what you didn't shoot. B-roll lets you:
- Cut out mistakes without jump cuts
- Add visual interest when talking head gets boring
- Show product in use while voice-over explains
- Extend or compress time as needed

---

**Sub-Framework 4: Product Beauty Shots**

**What It Is**:
High-quality, close-up, glamorous shots of the product being sold.

**The Shots You Need**:
```
PRODUCT BEAUTY SHOTS:
├── Package/box (unopened, pristine)
├── Contents spread out (what's inside)
├── Close-ups of key components
├── Product in use (hands interacting)
├── Before/after comparison
└── Scale shots (size relative to known object)
```

**Kennedy's Infomercial Standard**:
Watch QVC or infomercials. They rotate the product slowly, zoom in on details, show it from every angle. Do the same.

**When to Use in Edit**:
- During product description voice-over
- While listing components/bonuses
- During price/value stack explanation
- When you want to cut presenter but keep audio

**Production Tips**:
1. **Lighting**: Soft, even, no harsh shadows
2. **Background**: Clean, uncluttered, contrasting
3. **Movement**: Slow rotation or push-in (not static)
4. **Focus**: Rack focus to highlight specific features
5. **Multiple angles**: Shoot each product position 3+ times

---

**Sub-Framework 5: Post-Production is Where Everything Happens**

**What It Is**:
The editing/assembly phase where you fix mistakes, adjust pacing, and optimize for conversion.

**Kennedy's Post-Production Priorities**:
```
RANK ORDER OF POST WORK:
1. Remove/fix mistakes
   ├── Fumbles, stumbles, brain farts
   ├── Mis-spoken facts
   └── Energy drops

2. Optimize pacing
   ├── Cut dead air
   ├── Tighten responses
   └── Speed up slow sections

3. Add visual interest
   ├── B-roll over talking head
   ├── Graphics for key points
   └── Text overlay for emphasis

4. Handle transitions
   ├── Format changes smooth
   ├── Music/sound bridges
   └── No jarring cuts

5. Maximize selling moments
   ├── Product shots during offer
   ├── Testimonials during proof
   └── Urgency graphics during close
```

**Kennedy's Core Truth**:
> "You can't have enough footage."

Because in editing, you'll wish you had:
- One more angle to cover that awkward moment
- One more product shot for that section
- One more testimonial to drive the point home
- One more demonstration angle

**Best Practices**:
1. **Always shoot multiple takes** of key sections
2. **Keep camera rolling** between "takes" (gold happens accidentally)
3. **Shoot cutaways** of everything (you'll use them)
4. **Record room tone** (30 seconds of silence for audio editing)
5. **Test footage immediately** before releasing crew/talent

---

## FRAMEWORK CLUSTER 8.3: Presenter Tells to Avoid

**Category**: 8.3 - Presenter Behavior
**Principle**: Your body language and tone shouldn't telegraph "now I'm selling you."

### Presenter Mistakes That Kill Sales

Kennedy identifies subtle and not-so-subtle behaviors that destroy credibility during the selling moment.

**Sub-Framework 1: Physiological Change (Content → Commercial)**

**What It Is**:
Visible change in presenter's energy, tone, or body language when transitioning from teaching to selling.

**What It Looks Like**:
```
THE TELLS:
├── Voice drops (less confident)
├── Speech speeds up (hurrying through it)
├── Body tenses up (discomfort visible)
├── Eye contact breaks (looking away/down)
├── Smile becomes forced
├── Hands go into pockets
└── Shuffling/shifting stance
```

**Kennedy's Warning**:
> "The worst version of it is the person who delivers content content content content content and then they sort of physiologically change and now they deliver a commercial."

**Why This Kills Sales**:
Your discomfort makes them uncomfortable. If YOU don't believe in the pitch, why should THEY?

**The Fix**:
1. **No borders mindset**: It's all selling, there is no "now I pitch"
2. **Same energy throughout**: Teaching energy = selling energy
3. **Rehearse the commercial more**: So it's as smooth as content
4. **Believe in the offer**: If you don't, fix the offer
5. **Match your personality**: If you're low-key, stay low-key

**Kennedy's Truth**:
There should be no discernible moment where content ends and commercial begins. It should flow as one continuous value delivery.

---

**Sub-Framework 2: Any Hint of Apology**

**What It Is**:
Apologetic language or tone when presenting the offer or asking for the sale.

**What This Sounds Like**:
```
APOLOGETIC LANGUAGE:
├── "I know this is expensive, but..."
├── "I hate to ask, but..."
├── "Now I have to do the pitch..."
├── "Sorry to sell you, but..."
├── "Bear with me while I..."
└── "I hope you don't mind, but..."
```

**Why This Destroys Sales**:
Apologizing for the offer suggests:
- The price is too high (so they should resist)
- The product isn't worth it (or you wouldn't apologize)
- You're uncomfortable selling (so it must be bad)

**Kennedy's Rule**:
NEVER apologize for selling. If the offer is fair and the product delivers value, the sale is in THEIR best interest.

**The Fix**:
1. **Reframe**: You're not "selling them," you're "helping them get access"
2. **Believe it**: If you don't believe offer is fair, fix it
3. **Confident language**: "Here's how to get started..."
4. **No hedging**: Remove "just," "only," "might," "maybe"
5. **Assume the sale**: Talk as if they're already buying

**Correct Framing**:
"I've shown you the problem, I've shown you the solution, and now I'm going to show you how to get your hands on this..."

---

**Sub-Framework 3: Self-Disparaging Humor When Shifting to Selling**

**What It Is**:
Making jokes at your own expense about "now comes the pitch" or "time to sell you something."

**What This Sounds Like**:
```
SELF-DISPARAGING SHIFTS:
├── "Now for the part where I try to take your money..."
├── "I bet you knew this was coming..."
├── "Time for the dog and pony show..."
├── "Here comes the sales pitch..."
└── "My boss is making me do this part..."
```

**Why Presenters Do This**:
- Discomfort with selling
- Trying to be "relatable"
- Diffusing anticipated resistance
- Protecting ego ("I know this is cheesy, but...")

**Why This Kills Sales**:
You've just told them:
- This next part is bad/unwanted
- You don't fully believe in it either
- They should resist what's coming
- The pitch is separate from (and less valuable than) the content

**The Fix**:
1. **No jokes about selling**: Treat it with same respect as content
2. **Confidence**: The offer is the solution to what you just taught
3. **Seamless transition**: (See kennedy-transition skill)
4. **Value frame**: "Here's how to implement everything I just showed you..."

**Kennedy's Approach**:
The offer IS the implementation mechanism. You taught them WHAT and WHY. The offer is HOW. That's valuable, not apologize-worthy.

---

**Sub-Framework 4: Disrespectful Handling of Product**

**What It Is**:
Physical treatment of the product that suggests it's not valuable.

**What This Looks Like**:
```
DISRESPECTFUL HANDLING:
├── Tossing product aside
├── Fumbling/dropping it
├── Stacking carelessly
├── Covering it up
├── Treating it as prop, not product
└── Not looking at it while discussing it
```

**Kennedy's Television Rule**:
> "You're on television. You're not on stage. Therefore, the camera. You don't take the product and do this. You do this. You're on camera. You're doing TV."

Translation: On TV, product gets held toward camera, rotated slowly, handled with care. Like QVC demonstrates jewelry.

**Why It Matters**:
Your physical treatment of product signals its value. If YOU don't treat it as precious, why should THEY value it?

**The Correct Way**:
1. **Hold it properly**: Toward camera if recording, toward audience if live
2. **Handle with care**: As if it's valuable (because it is)
3. **Show details**: Rotate it, point to features, open it
4. **Look at it**: Your eyes should be on product when discussing it
5. **Reverence**: Treat it the way they should treat it

**QVC Standard**:
Watch QVC hosts with jewelry. They handle it like it's precious, they show every angle, they put it on, they admire it. They SELL IT with their handling.

---

**Sub-Framework 5: Confusion/Fumbling**

**What It Is**:
Presenter appears confused about offer details, pricing, process, or can't find materials.

**What This Looks Like**:
```
FUMBLING BEHAVIORS:
├── "Wait, what's the price again?"
├── "Let me find that slide..."
├── "Where's my notes..."
├── Checking with staff mid-pitch
├── Correcting yourself multiple times
└── Uncertain about guarantee/terms
```

**Why This Destroys Sales**:
If YOU don't know your own offer, how can THEY trust it?

Confusion creates:
- Doubt (is this legitimate?)
- Uncertainty (what am I actually buying?)
- Amateur perception (is this a real business?)

**Kennedy's Standard**:
You can fumble teaching. You can stumble on a name or date. But you should be able to recite the offer in your sleep.

**The Fix**:
1. **Memorize the pitch**: If you memorize nothing else, memorize this
2. **Rehearse until automatic**: The offer should flow without thought
3. **Have backup**: Order forms, visual aids in multiple places
4. **Know every detail**: Price, terms, guarantee, bonuses, process
5. **Confidence**: Deliver offer like you've done it 1000 times

**Kennedy's Priority**:
If limited preparation time, spend it on the close. The content can be rough. The pitch cannot.

---

**Sub-Framework 6: Hurrying the Pitch**

**What It Is**:
Rushing through the offer, speaking faster, compressing the close to "get it over with."

**What This Sounds Like**:
```
HURRYING TELLS:
├── Speech speeds up
├── Skipping components
├── "Quickly, let me tell you..."
├── Collapsing the stack
├── Shortening the guarantee
└── Rushed call to action
```

**Why Presenters Do This**:
- Running out of time (poor planning)
- Uncomfortable selling (want it over)
- Fear of boring audience
- Didn't rehearse the close

**Why This Kills Sales**:
Hurrying communicates:
- This isn't important
- I'm not confident in this
- You should skip this too (and not buy)

**Kennedy's Rule**:
> "Don't short the close. If you're going to short anything, short the content."

**The Fix**:
1. **Time box the presentation**: (See kennedy-architecture)
2. **Protect close time**: Never let content bleed into close
3. **Rehearse to time**: Know exactly how long close takes
4. **Slow down intentionally**: Force yourself to pause
5. **Value each element**: Every component gets its moment

**Proper Pacing**:
The close should feel SLOWER than content. Pauses matter. Let price sink in. Let bonuses land. Give guarantee weight.

## Kennedy's Key Principles (Delivery)

### Physical Environment:
1. **If selling product, have product THERE** (physical or visible on screen)
2. **Make buying easy, leaving hard** (environment control)
3. **Visible stampede sells** (social proof through environment)
4. **Second chances work** (break period for procrastinators)

### Video/Technical:
1. **You're doing TV, not recording event** (production standards matter)
2. **Get more footage than you think you need** (post-production is everything)
3. **Format changes maintain attention** (8-12 minute variety)
4. **Physical sets beat green screen** (for tangible products)

### Presenter Behavior:
1. **Never hurt the pitch by hurrying it** (protect close time)
2. **No physiological change content → commercial** (seamless energy)
3. **Never apologize for selling** (offer = value)
4. **Respect your product** (handle it like it's precious)
5. **Know the offer cold** (fumbling kills credibility)

---

## How to Use These Frameworks

### For Physical Room Setup:

**Step 1**: Map the room
- Where are exits?
- Where can product tables go?
- What's the sight line from seats to sales area?

**Step 2**: Block and guide
- Tables near exits (not blocking, but visible)
- Staff positioned to intercept
- Clear signage for "Order Here"

**Step 3**: Create visibility
- Stack product high
- Make buying activity visible
- Position staff in motion

**Step 4**: Set expectations early
- Tell them they'll be pitched
- Explain order process in advance
- Give specific instructions

---

### For Video Production:

**Pre-Production**:
1. Choose format(s) based on content purpose
2. Decide physical set vs green screen
3. Plan format changes every 8-12 minutes
4. Create shot list including B-roll

**Production Day**:
1. Shoot multiple takes of everything
2. Capture all B-roll on shot list
3. Get product beauty shots from every angle
4. Record room tone for audio editing
5. Keep camera rolling between takes

**Post-Production**:
1. Remove all fumbles/mistakes
2. Optimize pacing (cut dead air)
3. Add B-roll for visual variety
4. Insert product shots during offer
5. Polish transitions between formats

---

### For Presenter Training:

**Before Presentation**:
1. Memorize the pitch (even if nothing else)
2. Rehearse close until automatic
3. Practice product handling (if applicable)
4. Time the close (protect that time)
5. Remove apologetic language from script

**During Presentation**:
1. Maintain same energy content → commercial
2. Never apologize for selling
3. No self-disparaging jokes about pitch
4. Handle product with reverence
5. SLOW DOWN during close (don't hurry)

**After Presentation**:
1. Review video for tells
2. Get feedback on energy shift
3. Note any fumbles (fix for next time)
4. Check if you rushed anything

## Usage Notes

**Best for:**
- Physical room event planning and logistics
- Video/webcast production planning
- Presenter training (what NOT to do)
- Post-production guidance
- Creating sales-optimized environments

**Not ideal for:**
- Slide design specifics
- Webinar software/tech
- Pre-presentation funnel
- Post-presentation follow-up

**Kennedy's Unique Contribution**:
Most webinar training focuses on content and slides. Kennedy brings:
- Infomercial-level production standards
- Physical room sales prevention tactics
- TV-quality product presentation
- Presenter behavior awareness (the "tells")

---

## Common Mistakes

### Physical Room:
- Sales area hidden or hard to find
- No visible product display
- Staff seated behind tables (not engaging)
- Surprise pitch (didn't set expectations)

### Video Production:
- Only one camera angle (boring)
- No B-roll captured (can't edit properly)
- Green screen looks cheap (should've built set)
- Presenter looks off-camera at notes

### Presenter Behavior:
- Energy drops when pitch starts (physiological change)
- "Sorry about this, but..." (apologizing for offer)
- Jokes about "here comes the pitch" (self-disparaging)
- Tosses product aside (disrespectful)
- "Um, what was the price again?" (fumbling)
- Rushes through close (hurrying the pitch)

---

## The Kennedy Standard

> "All your great work is going to be done in post. Post-production is where everything happens, and you can't have enough footage."

Kennedy's delivery frameworks elevate group selling from "recorded speech" to "professional production."

His standards:
- Environment is strategic, not accidental
- Production quality signals product quality
- Presenter behavior is trained, not natural
- The close deserves MORE time and energy than content

**The Bottom Line**:
You can have great content, great offer, great everything... and still kill the sale with:
- Poor room setup that makes buying hard
- Amateurish production that signals low value
- Presenter tells that telegraph discomfort

Delivery isn't "the details." It's the sale.

*"You're on television. You're not on stage. Therefore, the camera. You don't take the product and do this. You do this. You're on camera. You're doing TV."* — Dan Kennedy
