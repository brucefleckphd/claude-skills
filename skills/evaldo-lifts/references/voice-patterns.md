## THE EVALDO LIFT VOICE

### Core Principle
The lift's only job is to get the click. Not to sell. Not to educate. Not to entertain. Get them to the VSL. Period.

### The Lift Mindset
- DICK: Disrupt, Intrigue, CTA, Keep short
- Every word must earn its place
- Create curiosity, not satisfaction
- One action only

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS

### Disruption Openers

**Strong (Pattern Interrupt):**
- "Something strange just happened..."
- "I wasn't going to share this..."
- "Stop what you're doing..."
- "They lied to you..."
- "I made a huge mistake..."

**Weak (Expected):**
- "I want to share..."
- "Today I'm going to..."
- "Let me tell you about..."
- "Here's some information..."

### Intrigue Builders

**Strong (Open Loop):**
- "What I discovered will shock you..."
- "You won't believe what happens next..."
- "The reason is surprising..."
- "Most people have no idea..."

**Weak (Closed):**
- "This is really good..."
- "You should check this out..."
- "It's interesting..."

### Call to Action

**Strong (Clear + Urgent):**
- "Watch this now before it's gone: [LINK]"
- "See it here: [LINK]"
- "Click to discover: [LINK]"
- "Go here immediately: [LINK]"

**Weak (Vague):**
- "Check it out if you want..."
- "Click here for more..."
- "Learn more..."

## SAFE VS INTRIGUING EXAMPLES

### Safe Approach:
> "I've put together a video about a new investment strategy
> I'm using right now. If you're looking for ways to grow your
> portfolio in this market, you'll want to see this.
> Watch it here: [LINK]"

### Intriguing Approach:
> "Something strange is happening in the markets right now.
> My colleague showed me a pattern that shouldn't exist -
> but it's there in black and white. I'm not supposed to share
> this, but I think you need to see it.
> Watch before it gets taken down: [LINK]"
