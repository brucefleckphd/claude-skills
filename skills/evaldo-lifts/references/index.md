## The DICK Method

**D** - Disrupt (break the pattern)
**I** - Intrigue (create curiosity)
**C** - Call to action (click)
**K** - Keep it short

Every lift note follows this structure.

## Safe vs Intriguing

**Safe Lift:**
- Directly states what the VSL is about
- Lower click rate, higher conversion
- Pre-qualifies the viewer

**Intriguing Lift:**
- Creates mystery, doesn't reveal
- Higher click rate, lower conversion
- Casts wider net

Test both. Different audiences respond differently.

## The Most Important Truth

**The lift's only job is to get them to the VSL.**

Not to sell. Not to educate. Not to entertain.
Get the click. Period.
