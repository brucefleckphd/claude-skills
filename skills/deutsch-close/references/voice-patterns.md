# David Deutsch Voice Patterns - Close

## Close-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing or evaluating Deutsch-style closes.

## THE DEUTSCH CLOSE VOICE

### Core Principle
The close needs PASSION. This is a life-changing moment. Not "please click the button" - this is a CROSSROADS.

### The Passion Standard
"You can see the kind of passion you need to put into that. It can't just be like, oh, please click the button below. No, it's got to be, this is a life-changing moment now for you."

## VOICE PATTERNS BY CLOSE ELEMENT

### 1. Future Pace Pattern
Paint the vivid transformed life:
- "Imagine opening the newspaper every morning and seeing your stocks went UP"
- "Imagine waking up and NOT being reminded you have arthritis"
- "Picture yourself knowing EXACTLY what to do"

**Voice Markers:**
- "Imagine..."
- "Picture..."
- "What would it feel like..."
- "See yourself..."
- Vivid, sensory, specific

### 2. Crossroads Close Pattern
Two paths, life-changing choice:
- "You're at a crossroads right now"
- "Path 1: Keep doing what you're doing (pain continues)"
- "Path 2: Take action today (transformation begins)"
- "This isn't about buying a newsletter - it's about CHANGING YOUR LIFE"

**Voice Markers:**
- Decision language
- Contrast between paths
- Elevated stakes
- Life-changing framing

### 3. Price Minimization Pattern
Make price feel inconsequential:
- "Only a dollar a day"
- "Less than a cup of coffee"
- "A consultant charges $60/hour - this is pennies"
- "$300 is nothing to make a million dollars"

**Voice:** Comparison, perspective, reframing

### 4. Guarantee Voice Pattern
POSITIVE, not negative:
- WRONG: "If you hate it, we'll refund you"
- RIGHT: "You've got to love it, you've got to make money, or..."
- Express YOUR confidence: "The reason I guarantee this is because I KNOW it works"

**Voice Markers:**
- Positive framing
- Confidence expression
- Your belief shows
- Visual elements (box, signature)

### 5. Scarcity Pattern
Real urgency:
- Time: "Offer good for 30 days only"
- Quantity: "Only X spots available"
- Natural: "Herb from Amazon might run out"

**Voice:** Urgent but believable, not hype

### 6. Risk Transfer Pattern
Move all risk to your shoulders:
- "I've taken all the risk on my shoulders"
- "There's no way you can look stupid"
- "You can always undo it"

**Voice:** Protective, confident, reassuring

---

## THE RESPONSIBILITY TRANSFER

Hand ownership to prospect:
- "I've done everything I can"
- "Made the best deal"
- "Removed the risk"
- "Now it's YOUR responsibility to change your life"
- "I can't want that for you more than you want it for you"

---

## THE FAQ EXTENSION

After main close, mini sales pitches:
- "If you're still here, maybe you have questions..."
- Each FAQ is a new angle
- Each answer loops back to CTA
- Extends the close without repeating

---

## THE EXACT INSTRUCTIONS PATTERN

Remove all confusion:
- "Take your mouse"
- "Move it to the red button below"
- "Click"
- "You'll see a page like this"
- "Fill in X"
- "In 6 days, product arrives"
- "When it does, do this first"

**Voice:** Step by step, hand-holding, no ambiguity
