# Deutsch Close

David Deutsch close frameworks. Use when writing or improving closes, guarantees, offers, and final CTAs. Covers price minimization, bonuses, guarantee presentation, scarcity, future pace, and crossroads close.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing or improving closes
- Crafting guarantee copy
- Structuring offers with bonuses
- Creating urgency with scarcity
- Building final CTAs

## Critical Lessons: Close Optimization

### Lesson 1: Exact Instructions Are Non-Negotiable

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** Copy ends with CTA button but no instructions.

```
WEAK:
"Don't make them wait. Don't make YOURSELF wait.

[GET THE SYSTEM - $97]"
```

**THE FIX:** Tell them EXACTLY what to do, step by step.

```
STRONG:
"Here's what to do:

Scroll down. See that red button? Click it. You'll go to a secure checkout page. Enter your information—takes 30 seconds. And the moment you complete your order, you'll get instant access. Tonight, you'll convert your first course. By next week, you'll have an army.

[GET THE SYSTEM - $97]"
```

**WHY IT WORKS:** Removes ALL friction. They don't have to think. They just follow instructions. Many copywriters skip this. Don't.

### Lesson 2: Make Scarcity REAL

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** "Only 200 spots available" without explanation feels manufactured.

**THE FIX:** Name a real person or real constraint.

```
WEAK:
"I'm only making this available to 200 people at this price."

STRONG:
"I have one support person. Sarah. She handles everything. More than 200 people and she drowns. I've seen it happen before with other products—inbox overwhelmed, quality drops, people don't get the attention they need.

I won't do that to her. And I won't do that to you."
```

**THE RULE:** If you can't name a real reason for scarcity, don't use scarcity.

### Lesson 3: Crossroads Fear Must Be TERRIFYING

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** Negative path is uncomfortable but not painful enough.

```
WEAK:
"A year from now, you're sitting at the same desk. Same folder of courses. Maybe a few MORE courses now."
```

This is mild discomfort. Not fear. Not enough to drive action.

```
STRONG:
"Five years go by like this. Then ten.

That business idea you've been nursing? Someone else builds it. Someone who EXECUTED.

That book you were going to write? Never happens. The methodology dies with you.

Your kids grow up watching you buy courses you don't finish. They learn that's what people do—consume, collect, tell themselves 'someday.'

The gap between what you KNOW and what you DO doesn't just stay wide.

It becomes WHO YOU ARE."
```

**THE RULE:** The negative path isn't "same situation." It's PERMANENT identity as a non-executor. Legacy of incomplete potential. Make it hurt.

### Lesson 4: Future Pace Must Be SENSORY

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** Abstract transformation language.

```
WEAK:
"You'll be a completely different person. Free from the gap."
```

**THE FIX:** Put them in the scene with sensory details.

```
STRONG:
"You wake up tomorrow. The sun is coming through the window. You smell coffee brewing—you set the timer last night. You grab your mug and sit down at your desk.

But something's different.

Your AI has been WORKING while you slept. That email sequence you needed? Written. That sales page? Done.

You check your phone. Three sales notifications from overnight. Customers who bought while you were sleeping.

You smile. Take a sip of coffee."
```

**THE RULE:** If they can't SEE, SMELL, FEEL it, it's not vivid enough.
