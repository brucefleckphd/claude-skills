# Brunson Close Frameworks - Complete Index

## Tier 1 Frameworks (Ace - Foundation Systems)

### **The Stack (Armand Morin's Method)** - 6.1 Offer Presentation
The master offer presentation system. Present components and bonuses one at a time, then restack the ENTIRE offer after each addition. By the end, you've recapped the full offer 6+ times so they remember everything. The human mind only remembers the last thing shown - the stack solves this problem.

**When to use:** Presenting your offer in any webinar or sales presentation

**Key insight:** You should feel embarrassed by how repetitive it is. If you're comfortable, you're not doing enough. People will laugh - that's a good sign.

**Source quote:** "He said, so I invented this thing called the stack... by the time you've done the stack or six times you're gonna be so embarrassed and I remember first time I did this at a seminar people were laughing... but guess what everybody knew exactly what the offer was and they bought like crazy."

---

### **The Stack Success Pattern** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Validation)
Russell attributes over $10 million in direct sales to the stack. Armand closed 30-50% of 1,000 people (~$1M). Russell's first time using it made him #1 salesperson with ~$100K. Every time Russell deviated from the stack, sales bombed.

**When to use:** Validating whether to use the stack methodology

**Key insight:** If you think you're "too smart" for the stack, expect to bomb (Russell's direct experience).

---

### **Break and Rebuild Belief Pattern** - 4.2 Content Structure
For each teaching point: (1) Identify false belief audience holds, (2) Break that pattern by showing why it's wrong, (3) Rebuild with new pattern, (4) Take them through your discovery journey.

**When to use:** Teaching content that contradicts existing beliefs

**Key insight:** If you only teach new information, they learn but don't buy. If you break and rebuild belief patterns, paradigm shift occurs and they become buyers.

---

## Tier 2 Frameworks (King - Core Systems)

### **If-All Statements (Price Justification)** - 6.2 Price Psychology
Show total high value, then ask series of "if-all" questions: "If all that this package did was [single benefit], would it be worth [high price]?" Repeat with 3-5 different single benefits, getting agreement each time.

**When to use:** After revealing total package value, before revealing actual price

**Key insight:** This solidifies the high price in their mind before discounting, making the discount powerful instead of destroying credibility.

---

### **Value Justification Before Discount** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
After showing high price, you MUST justify it before discounting. If you immediately say "don't worry, I'm not charging that," you lose all credibility and the anchor is worthless.

**When to use:** Revealing high price anchor before actual price

**Key insight:** Spend 2-3 minutes justifying high price with if-all statements before discounting. If you're rushing to discount, you're doing it wrong.

---

### **Sixteen Closes Principle** - 6.8 Multi-Close Strategy
After initial offer and price reveal, continue with multiple additional closes (Russell uses up to 16+). Each approaches buying decision from different psychological angle. Mix from Fladlien, Morin, original sources.

**When to use:** After initial offer and price reveal, pushing fence-sitters to buy

**Key insight:** If you only close once, only the immediately ready buy. If you close 10-16 times from different angles, you convert fence-sitters who need different psychological triggers.

---

### **Fence-Sitter Philosophy** - 6.8 Multi-Close Strategy (Principle)
After price reveal and initial close, you have immediate buyers and fence-sitters. All remaining slides exist for ONE purpose: tip fence-sitters over the edge into buying. Keep pushing with different psychological angles.

**When to use:** Understanding the purpose of multiple closes after initial offer

**Key insight:** Every subsequent slide should push toward the order. No exceptions.

---

### **Money Replenishes Close** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Close)
Demonstrate that money is renewable (paycheck comes every two weeks) but time is not (missed moments never return). Since money replenishes but time doesn't, invest money to save time.

**When to use:** Overcome "I can't afford it" objection by contrasting renewable vs non-renewable resources

---

### **Break Old Habits Close** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Close)
Acknowledge: people get excited on webinars but do nothing the next day because old habits are hard to break. Only way to break the habit is to invest NOW - otherwise they'll slide back to exact same routine.

**When to use:** Address implementation gap between excitement and action

---

### **Money or Excuses Dichotomy** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Close)
Present binary choice: people can have money OR excuses, but not both. Force them to decide - either sign up and make money, or come up with excuses (can't afford it, no time, etc.).

**When to use:** Create stark choice that eliminates middle ground and forces decision

---

### **Us vs Them (Tale of Two People)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Close)
Describe two types: (1) Timid/nervous who think it's cool but never take action (you don't want to work with them), and (2) Action-takers who step up (people you want). Force self-identification.

**When to use:** Segment audience and create social pressure to be in "action-taker" group

---

### **Reluctant Hero Close** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Close)
Remind audience you're nothing special - you struggled with same things. You can't do X, you can't do Y, spent 10 years figuring this out the hard way. They can do it the hard way too, or just plug in what you discovered.

**When to use:** Overcome the "you're special, I'm not" objection

---

### **Armand's Stack Origin Story** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Case Study)
Russell watched Armand close 30-50% of 1,000 people (~$1M). Armand taught: people only remember last thing shown, so restack continuously to keep everything in memory. Made Russell $10M+.

**When to use:** Understanding origin and validation of stack methodology

---

### **Money Replenishes vs Time Doesn't** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Contrarian Insight)
Most think money is precious and scarce. But money is renewable (comes every two weeks, government provides it). Time is non-renewable (missed moments never return). Flips traditional scarcity mindset.

**When to use:** Reframe investment by contrasting renewable vs non-renewable resources

---

### **Continuous Value Re-Justification** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
After each stack element, say "If you only got THIS alone, it would still be worth the investment" - then reveal there's MORE. Repeat at each element. Continuously re-justifies price while building anticipation.

**When to use:** Build cumulative value perception throughout stack presentation

---

### **Voicemail Qualification Strategy** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
Offer voicemail line for questions BUT require full contact details plus credit card info (promise not to charge). Qualifies serious buyers, captures lead info, allows personal follow-up. 25% sales increase.

**When to use:** Capture high-intent prospects who have remaining questions

---

### **Stack Component Architecture** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Model)
Core offer (main modules) presented first with total value. Then bonuses added one at a time with stated value. Between bonuses, insert testimonials and mini-closes. After each addition, restack entire offer with cumulative value.

**When to use:** Organizing elements of your offer for maximum impact

---

## Tier 3 Frameworks (Queen - Supporting Systems)

### **Price Drop Sequence** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
After if-all statements, acknowledge you could charge high price but won't. Mention even higher social proof prices. Then price drop: "I'm not gonna charge 5 grand, not 2,000, gonna do it for 1,000." Each false high price creates additional contrast.

**When to use:** Revealing actual price after establishing high anchor value

---

### **Continuous Call to Action Pattern** - 6.7 Call to Action (Process)
After first price reveal, include CTA on EVERY subsequent slide. Every bonus, close, and element should end with "click the order form." All remaining slides push fence-sitters to order.

**When to use:** After initial price reveal through end of webinar

---

### **Testimonial Integration in Stack** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Process)
Between stack components and bonuses, insert testimonials. These "smiley faces" strengthen and fortify components you're adding. Provide proof that things you're stacking actually work.

**When to use:** Building credibility during offer presentation

---

### **Restack After Every Addition** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Process)
Every time you add something (component, bonus, testimonial), restack ENTIRE offer from beginning including all cumulative values. Each restack builds value geometrically. By end, should have recapped full offer at least 6 times.

**When to use:** Adding each new component or bonus to your offer

---

### **False High Price Social Proof** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
After establishing stacked value price, mention even higher social proof: "We had people pay us a million dollars for something similar." Creates additional reference point that makes even the high stacked price seem like bargain.

**When to use:** Creating additional price contrast before final reveal

---

### **Mini Closes Between Stack Elements** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Process)
Between stack components, insert "mini-closes" - small selling moments that keep buying energy high. Quick reasons to act, benefit restatements, urgency nudges. Combined with testimonials, fortify each component addition.

**When to use:** Maintaining momentum during stack presentation

---

### **The Embarrassment Test** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Diagnostic)
How to know if you're doing stack right: You should feel embarrassed by how repetitive it is. People should be laughing because it's getting ridiculous. If you're comfortable, you're not doing enough restacking.

**When to use:** Gauging whether you're doing stack correctly

**Key insight:** Embarrassment and laughter are success indicators, not failure indicators.

---

### **Total Value Cumulation Display** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Process)
Every time you add component or bonus, show individual value of that item, then show NEW cumulative total value of everything combined. Running cumulative total builds perceived value geometrically.

**When to use:** Adding each bonus to the stack

---

### **Core Offer vs Bonuses Architecture** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Model)
Core offer = main deliverable modules of your program (3-5 components). Bonuses = additional valuable tools that support the core (2-4 additions). Core establishes foundation value, bonuses multiply it.

**When to use:** Structuring what goes in core offer vs what becomes bonuses

---

### **Core Training Module Framework** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Model)
Design core offering as 6-8 day teaching sequence. Imagine someone hired you and came to office. Day 1 = Module 1, Day 2 = Module 2, etc. By end of week, they know complete system.

**When to use:** Structuring core training program being sold on webinar

---

### **The Module-as-Day Mental Model** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Metaphor)
Imagine someone hired you personally for week of training at your office. What would you teach each day? Day 1 = Module 1. Day 2 = Module 2. Natural, logical structure that's comprehensive but not overwhelming.

**When to use:** Structuring core training program for webinar offer

**Key insight:** 6-8 modules is sweet spot. Less than 6 feels incomplete. More than 8 feels overwhelming.

---

### **The Bonuses That Make It Irresistible** - 6.3 Bonus Strategy (Process)
Core program = foundation. Bonuses = what makes it irresistible, slam-dunk, can't-say-no. After defining core, brainstorm: what additional elements make this so good they HAVE to buy?

**When to use:** After core program is defined, building complete offer

---

### **Disposable Income Reframe** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Reposition purchase not as new money out-of-pocket, but as redirecting money they already spend on non-investment items (movies, dining) toward something that generates returns.

**When to use:** Reframe price as investment rather than expense

---

### **Asset vs Liability Framework** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Reference Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad: poor buy liabilities (things that take money - cars, boats), rich buy assets (things that generate money). Position offer as asset.

**When to use:** Educate audience on difference between spending and investing

---

### **Information Alone Is Useless** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Acknowledge you've shared valuable information, but information alone won't save them. They need systems, action steps, coaching, accountability, implementation tools - which paid package provides.

**When to use:** Justify why they need full package after already receiving free content

---

### **Money is Good (Tool for Exchange)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Reframe money as neutral - not evil, not bad, just tool for exchange. Remove emotional baggage around spending by showing it's simply trading one thing for another.

**When to use:** Overcome money guilt or negative associations with spending

---

### **Your Two Choices (High Price Justification)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Explain you had two choices: charge $97 and sell to thousands (but can't serve anyone well), or charge more ($2,000) and provide personal attention and better service. High price is benefit.

**When to use:** Justify high price point by explaining service/attention tradeoff

---

### **Their Two Choices (Future Pacing)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Present their two choices: Choice 1 - invest now, have system running and making money in 2-3 weeks. Choice 2 - end webinar, go to bed, wake up tomorrow doing exact same thing.

**When to use:** Paint contrasting futures to make decision clear and emotionally compelling

---

### **Handhold Close (Process Walkthrough)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
Walk them through entire sign-up and onboarding process visually. Show order form, where they enter info, what page appears after purchase, how to log into members area. Remove intimidation.

**When to use:** Reduce purchase friction by showing exactly what happens after they buy

---

### **Say Goodbye Close** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
Have audience literally say goodbye to things they hate about current situation. "Say goodbye to phone phobia forever." "Say goodbye to that fear." Sprinkle throughout stack when addressing specific pain points.

**When to use:** Create emotional release by having them verbally dismiss fears and frustrations

---

### **If You Only Got Close** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
After revealing each stack element or bonus, say "If you only got this piece alone, it would still be worth the investment, but I'm also giving you..." then reveal next item. Repeat throughout stack.

**When to use:** Build value stacking by repeatedly justifying investment at each bonus

---

### **Now and Later Close (Future Pacing)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Compare NOW (current struggles, frustrations, things they don't know) with LATER (after they invest, when those problems magically disappear). Paint stark contrast to make transformation tangible.

**When to use:** Create contrast between current pain state and future solved state

---

### **Your Close Close (Final CTA Push)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
At very end, explicitly state webinar is over and direct them to take action right now. Keep pushing specific URL or button to click over and over.

**When to use:** End webinar with clear, repeated call to action

---

### **Secure Voicemail Question Line** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
On final slide, offer secure voicemail line where they can leave question along with full contact info AND credit card number (but you won't charge). Qualifies serious buyers. 25% sales increase.

**When to use:** Capture fence-sitters who have one remaining question preventing purchase

---

### **Stack Close Selection Principle** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
You don't have to use all closes every time. Pick ones that: (1) make most sense for your offer, (2) you genuinely enjoy delivering, (3) tie to your personality and feel authentic. Using too many can feel cheesy.

**When to use:** Decide which closes to use from full arsenal without sounding cheesy

---

### **Investment vs Consumption Reframe** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Position two types of spending: Consumption (money goes in, experience fades, money gone) vs Investment (money goes in, turns into more money). Your offer is investment that generates returns.

**When to use:** Reframe spending on offer as fundamentally different from regular spending

---

### **Quality Service Justifies Premium Price** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Frame pricing decision: low price = many customers = no personal attention vs high price = fewer customers = more time devoted to each. Most prefer more attention, which justifies higher price.

**When to use:** Turn high price objection into benefit by linking to service quality

---

### **Action-Taker Segmentation** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Distinction)
Explicitly describe two types: those who never take action (failures you don't want) and action-takers who step up (successful people you want). Make clear you only want group 2.

**When to use:** Create social pressure and self-selection by dividing audience

---

### **Habit Breaking Requires Investment** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Acknowledge pattern: people get excited on webinars but return to old habits next day. Only way to break habit pattern is to invest NOW - investment itself is pattern interrupt.

**When to use:** Address implementation gap between excitement and action

---

### **Fear Dismissal Through Verbalization** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Process)
Have audience literally say "goodbye" to specific fears as you address them. When revealing bonus/feature that eliminates pain point, pause and have them verbally dismiss it. Verbalization creates psychological release.

**When to use:** Create emotional release and closure on specific fears preventing action

---

### **Ordinary Person Positioning** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Explicitly state you're nothing special - you have same limitations they do. Difference is you found system that works despite being ordinary. Positions success as accessible to anyone.

**When to use:** Overcome "you're different/special" objection that prevents belief in their own success

---

### **Process Transparency (Handholding)** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Show exactly what happens after purchase - walk through order form, payment page, confirmation, members area login, where to ask questions. Making unknown process known removes friction.

**When to use:** Reduce purchase anxiety by making entire buying and onboarding process visible

---

### **Money Has No Emotions** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Address love-hate relationship people have with money by removing all emotion from it. Money is not good or evil - just neutral tool for exchange, like trading food for money at grocery store.

**When to use:** Overcome emotional resistance and guilt around spending money

---

### **Limited Capacity Creates Value Perception** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Principle)
Explicitly limiting number of customers (by charging more) increases perceived value because it signals higher service quality and personal attention. People want to be in smaller, well-served group.

**When to use:** Justify premium pricing through exclusivity and service quality

---

### **The Natasha Stack Success Case** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Case Study)
Natasha learned stack, felt cheesy but did it anyway. At first live event with 30-40 people, created physical boards with stack elements covered up. Pulled covers off one at a time. Sold 10 people at $5,000 = $50,000+ in sales.

**When to use:** Demonstrating stack effectiveness in live events

---

### **The Cheesy-But-Effective Paradox** - 6.2 Price Psychology (Contrarian Insight)
Russell watched speakers do price drops ("$10K... not 10K, only 9K... not 9K, only 8K..."). Thought it was "so cheesy," refused to do it. Got zero sales. Other speakers who did "cheesy" technique: massive sales.

**When to use:** When personal taste conflicts with what actually converts

**Key insight:** What you think is cheesy often works. What you think is sophisticated often fails. Test beats taste.

---

## Tier 4 Framework (10 - Edge Cases)

### **The One-Time Deviation Failure** - 6.1 Offer Presentation (Failure Pattern)
Russell thought he was "too smart" for the stack and had better idea. Did webinar without it and bombed completely. Was so embarrassed he never deviated again. Pattern repeats: proven methodology works, expert thinks they can improve it, expert bombs, expert returns religiously.

**When to use:** Considering whether to deviate from proven stack methodology

**Key insight:** Have you actually tested your "better way" against the stack? Or are you just assuming?

---
