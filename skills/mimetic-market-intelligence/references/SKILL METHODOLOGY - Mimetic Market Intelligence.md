# Skill Methodology: Mimetic Market Intelligence
## Captured February 21, 2026

*This document captures everything needed to build a repeatable skill that produces the same quality of output as the February 21, 2026 session. It is a methodology reference, not a skill implementation.*

---

## 1. Skill Overview and Purpose

**What it does:** Applies Rene Girard's mimetic desire theory to competitive market analysis. Instead of the standard "feature comparison" or "positioning matrix" approach, it analyzes what DESIRES each competitor mediates, where the market has unconsciously converged into sameness through mimetic imitation, and where genuine differentiation (or open positioning space) exists.

**Why it matters:** Traditional competitive analysis compares products and features. This analyzes the deeper layer -- what identity does the buyer want to inhabit, which competitor serves as the MODEL for that identity, and where have competitors all converged on mediating the same desires (making them indistinguishable). It reveals opportunities that feature-level analysis cannot see.

**Who it's for:** Any business owner or brand in a competitive market where multiple players are selling similar transformations. Most powerful in markets with heavy guru/personality branding (coaching, education, SaaS, consulting, agencies).

**Origin:** Session on February 21, 2026. Rich asked whether systems thinkers' models could be applied to marketing. After iterating through several theorists, Girard's mimetic desire theory produced three analysis documents that Rich called "phenomenal" and "one of the best outputs I've ever seen."

## 2. The 6-Document Output Structure

### Phase 1: Research-Driven (AI produces from external research alone)

#### Document 1: Anti-Mimetic Differentiator Analysis

**Purpose:** Map where the market has converged into mimetic sameness and where the client is genuinely different.

**Sections:**
1. **The Convergence Map** -- Identify clusters where competitors have unconsciously converged:
   - Promise convergence (what everyone promises)
   - Narrative convergence (the story everyone tells)
   - Offer structure convergence (how everyone packages)
   - Proof convergence (what results everyone showcases)
   - Language convergence (specific words/phrases adopted market-wide)
   - Enemy convergence (what everyone positions against)
2. **Where the Client Has Converged** -- Honest assessment of where the client's marketing uses the same promises, language, narratives, and structures as competitors. Must include specific quotes from the client's own marketing as evidence.
3. **Genuine Differentiation** -- What actually separates the client from the field. Not aspirational claims but provable, structural differences.
4. **Open Space** -- Unoccupied positioning territories that no competitor currently claims.

**Research required:** Deep web research on 10-20 competitors. Pull actual quotes from websites, social media, sales pages, course descriptions, podcast appearances, and public marketing materials. Every claim must be backed by specific evidence.

**Example output:** See `LIVE ANALYSIS - Anti-Mimetic Differentiator Results.md` (15 competitors analyzed, 4 promise clusters identified, 7 open positioning territories mapped).

---

#### Document 2: Competitor Desire Theft Analysis

**Purpose:** Map which specific DESIRES (not features) each competitor mediates, find contested zones (saturated) and uncontested zones (opportunity).

**For each competitor, produce:**
- **Primary desire mediated** -- The core identity the buyer wants to inhabit
- **Secondary desires** -- Supporting desires that reinforce the primary
- **The model presented** -- Who/what the competitor holds up as the aspirational figure
- **Evidence** -- 5-10 specific quotes from actual marketing showing desire mediation in action

**Then produce:**
- **Contested Desire Zones** -- Desires where 5+ competitors are all fighting over the same territory (saturated, market is numb)
- **Underserved Desire Zones** -- Desires that demonstrably exist in the market but that few or no competitors explicitly mediate. Must include evidence that the desire exists (surveys, trends, market data, backlash signals).

**Research required:** Same competitor set as Doc 1, but deeper on each individual competitor. Need their actual sales copy, social media language, testimonial framing, and positioning statements. Also need market-level research (industry surveys, trend reports, social media sentiment) to validate that underserved desires actually exist.

**Example output:** See `LIVE ANALYSIS - Competitor Desire Theft Results.md` (15 competitor desire profiles, 5 contested zones, 5 underserved zones identified with evidence).

---

#### Document 3: Client Desire Profile

**Purpose:** Apply the SAME depth of analysis to the client that was applied to every competitor. This is the document that enables strategic recommendations.

**Sections:**
1. **The Desire Profile** -- Primary desire mediated, secondary desires, the model presented, 10+ evidence quotes from actual client marketing
2. **Desire Mediation Strengths** -- Where the client's mimetic positioning is genuinely powerful (with evidence)
3. **Desire Mediation Gaps** -- Where the client's positioning is weak, invisible, or contradictory (with evidence)
4. **The Model Problem** -- Analysis of whether the client functions as external mediator (distant/godlike) or internal mediator (accessible/peer), and whether the current balance serves them
5. **The Desire Triangle** -- Subject (prospect), Model (client/students), Object (what is desired) -- is this clear and focused or fragmented?
6. **Side-by-Side Comparison** -- Table comparing the client to top 4-5 competitors on: primary desire, identity label, model visibility, social proof type, emotional activation, desire clarity, credibility depth
7. **Where the Client Wins/Loses in Mimetic Terms** -- Specific structural advantages and disadvantages

**Research required:** Deep research on the client's own public marketing -- website, social media, sales pages, podcast appearances, third-party reviews, historical documents. Must quote specific language, not make general observations.

**Example output:** See `LIVE ANALYSIS - Rich Schefren Desire Profile.md` (10 evidence quotes, 4 strengths, 5 gaps, full model problem analysis, side-by-side comparison table).

---

### Phase 2: Strategy (requires client conversation first)

#### Document 4: Visibility/Model Strategy

**Purpose:** How to fix the model invisibility problem -- making the client's aspirational identity visible and accessible enough to generate sustained mimetic desire.

**Requires asking the client:**
- What content are you already planning or producing?
- What channels are you open to (and which are you NOT willing to do)?
- What is your current content capacity (team, time, tools)?
- How do you feel about personal brand visibility vs. company brand?
- Are there formats you enjoy or despise? (Video, writing, podcasting, social media)
- What is your current audience size on each platform?
- How much of your time are you willing to allocate to visibility?

**Why conversation is needed:** The client may already have plans, strong preferences, or constraints the AI cannot know. Telling someone "you need to post daily on 5 platforms" when they have a 3-person team and hate video is useless advice.

---

#### Document 5: Desire Unification Strategy

**Purpose:** How to unify fragmented desires across products into one clear arc. Most businesses with multiple products accidentally mediate multiple conflicting desires, weakening all of them.

**Requires asking the client:**
- How do you see your products connecting? What is the intended journey?
- Which product do you consider your "flagship" or the one you most want to be known for?
- Are there products you are considering retiring, merging, or repositioning?
- What is the ONE transformation you want buyers to associate with your brand?
- If a stranger asked "what does [your brand] do?", what is the one-sentence answer you want them to give?

**Why conversation is needed:** Product architecture decisions involve business strategy, revenue dependencies, and personal vision that the AI cannot infer from public marketing alone. The client may have strong opinions about which products matter most.

---

#### Document 6: Internal Mediator Deployment Strategy

**Purpose:** How to restructure social proof for mimetic desire activation. Shift from external mediation (famous endorsements) to internal mediation (peer success stories that create "if they can do it, I can too" desire).

**This document is more prescriptive and can be produced from data + Docs 1-3.** It maps the client's current social proof structure, identifies gaps, and provides a specific plan for gathering and deploying peer-level success stories, before/after narratives, and named case studies.

**May still benefit from asking:**
- Do you have student/client success stories that are not currently public?
- Are there confidentiality constraints on sharing results?
- What does your current testimonial collection process look like?

## 3. The Seven Methodology Lessons

These are the corrections Rich gave during the session that transformed the output from mediocre to exceptional. They are non-negotiable quality standards for this skill.

### Lesson 1: Run the Ideas, Don't Just List Them

The first output was a list of 10 theoretical tool ideas ("here's what a mimetic analysis COULD do"). Rich's reaction: "I thought you were running the ideas to actually see if they paid off."

**The rule:** Never describe what an analysis could theoretically produce. Actually PRODUCE IT. Run it against real competitors, real data, real quotes. The value is in the executed analysis, not the concept of an analysis.

**What this means in practice:** When the skill runs, it must do the actual web research, pull actual quotes, analyze actual competitors, and produce filled-out analysis documents -- not templates or frameworks for the client to fill in.

### Lesson 2: Equal Depth on the Client as Competitors

The first competitor analysis did deep profiles on 15 competitors (primary desire, secondary desires, model, 5-10 evidence quotes each) but treated the client as an afterthought -- general observations instead of specific evidence.

**The rule:** The client gets the SAME depth of analysis as every competitor. Same number of evidence quotes. Same structural analysis. Same honesty. The client profile should be the longest and most detailed document, not the shortest.

**What this means in practice:** The AI must research the client's own marketing with the same rigor it researches competitors -- pulling quotes from their website, social media, sales pages, and public appearances.

### Lesson 3: Direction of Mimesis Matters

The first analysis assumed the client had "converged with competitors" -- implying the client was imitating others. Rich corrected: HE originated many of the ideas competitors were now using. The market copied HIM, not the other way around.

**The rule:** Always investigate WHO ORIGINATED WHAT. The direction of mimetic flow changes the entire analysis:
- If the client imitated competitors: "You need to differentiate."
- If competitors imitated the client: "Your original differentiation has been eroded by imitators. You need to re-establish the gap."

These are fundamentally different problems with different solutions.

**What this means in practice:** Before writing the convergence analysis, research the timeline. Who used these concepts first? When did competitors adopt them? The analysis must acknowledge origination and show the direction of flow.

### Lesson 4: Don't Insult the Client

Telling someone "you've converged with competitors" when they pioneered the category is insulting and factually wrong. It damages trust and makes the client dismiss the entire analysis.

**The rule:** Handle the originator scenario with precision. The correct framing when the client is the originator: "Your competitors have successfully imitated your positioning, which means your original differentiation no longer SOUNDS original to the market. The problem is not that you copied them -- it's that they copied you so well that the market can no longer tell the difference. Here's how to re-establish the gap."

**What this means in practice:** The skill must detect whether the client is likely the originator or the imitator (via timeline research) and frame the analysis accordingly. When in doubt, ask.

### Lesson 5: Use ALL of AI's External Research Capabilities

Rich's insight: "You're thinking too small. You have access to more information than anyone would have up until this moment in time."

**The rule:** The skill should leverage deep web research, not just internal business data. The power is in mapping the EXTERNAL market -- competitors, trends, desires propagating through communities, social media positioning, public marketing materials. Use web search, website fetching, social media analysis, industry reports, and any other available research tools.

**What this means in practice:** For each competitor, the AI should research their actual website, actual social media, actual sales pages, actual course descriptions, and actual public statements. No analysis should be based on the AI's training data alone -- it must be grounded in current, verifiable public information.

### Lesson 6: No Bullshit Claims

Rich pushed back hard on vague concepts like "desire propagation engine" and "tools for creating markets." Every output must be concrete, evidence-based, and actionable.

**The rule:** Quote real language. Name real names. Show real data. If something cannot be built or acted on, do not include it. No theoretical frameworks without concrete application. No aspirational language without evidence. No "this could potentially" -- either show it working or do not include it.

**What this means in practice:** Every claim in the analysis must be backed by a specific quote, a specific data point, or a specific observable pattern. The analysis should read like a forensic investigation, not a think piece.

### Lesson 7: Documents 4-6 Require Conversation

The first three documents (competitor analysis, desire theft, client profile) can be produced from research alone. But the STRATEGY documents (fixing visibility, unifying product messaging, deploying social proof) need client input.

**The rule:** The skill should PAUSE after Phase 1 and gather client input before producing Phase 2. The client may already have plans, things they don't want to do, or context the AI doesn't have. Producing strategy without conversation results in generic advice that ignores real constraints.

**What this means in practice:** Phase 1 delivers Docs 1-3 and then explicitly presents the questions needed for Phase 2. Phase 2 only runs after the client has responded.

## 4. Girardian Concepts Used and How Each Maps to Analysis

### Mimetic Desire
**Theory:** People want what they see others wanting. Desire is not innate -- it is mediated by a MODEL who shows the subject what to want.

**How it maps:** Each competitor profile identifies the DESIRE being mediated (not the product being sold). The analysis asks: "What identity does the buyer want to inhabit?" rather than "What features does the product have?"

### External vs. Internal Mediation
**Theory:** Distant models (celebrities, gurus) create admiration and reverence. Close/peer models create intense, actionable desire that drives purchase.

**How it maps:** The Client Desire Profile (Doc 3) analyzes whether the client functions as external mediator (too distant to activate purchase desire) or internal mediator (close enough to create "I can do that too" desire). The social proof analysis distinguishes between famous-name endorsements (external mediation) and peer success stories (internal mediation).

### Mimetic Convergence
**Theory:** Competitors unconsciously imitate each other until they become indistinguishable. This is not deliberate copying -- it is the natural result of watching each other and unconsciously adopting the same language, promises, and structures.

**How it maps:** The Anti-Mimetic Differentiator (Doc 1) specifically maps convergence across 6 dimensions: promise, narrative, offer structure, proof, language, and enemy. It identifies the specific clusters where the market has collapsed into sameness.

### Contested vs. Uncontested Desires
**Theory:** Like blue ocean strategy but at the DESIRE level, not the market level. Some desires are fought over by many competitors (contested/saturated). Others exist in the market but nobody is explicitly mediating them (uncontested/opportunity).

**How it maps:** The Competitor Desire Theft Analysis (Doc 2) produces a Contested Zone Map (desires where 5+ competitors compete) and an Underserved Zone Map (desires with evidence of market demand but no competitor explicitly serving them).

### The Skandalon (Model-Obstacle)
**Theory:** When the model is simultaneously the source of desire and the barrier to fulfillment. "I want to be like you, but your very existence makes me feel I never can."

**How it maps:** The Client Desire Profile (Doc 3) analyzes whether the client's credibility positioning creates a skandalon -- for example, "guru to the gurus" credibility that is so elevated it makes prospects feel the gap is unbridgeable rather than inspiring them to close it.

### Scapegoat Mechanism
**Theory:** Communities unite against a common enemy, and this shared opposition creates bonding and identity.

**How it maps:** The Anti-Mimetic Differentiator (Doc 1) maps Enemy Convergence -- what every competitor positions against. It identifies whether the client uses the same enemies as everyone else (convergence) or has a unique antagonist (differentiation).

### Direction of Mimesis
**Theory:** Mimetic flow has a direction. Someone originates; others imitate. The originator and the imitator face completely different strategic problems.

**How it maps:** The entire analysis must investigate who originated key concepts, language, and positioning. The Client Desire Profile (Doc 3) must correctly identify whether the client's convergence with competitors is because the client imitated them or because they imitated the client -- and frame the strategic implications accordingly.

## 6. Quality Standards

### What Makes Output Good

- **Every claim is backed by a specific quote or data point.** No general observations without evidence.
- **Competitors are analyzed with real current marketing language** pulled from live web research, not from AI training data or assumptions.
- **The client gets equal or greater depth than any competitor.** The client profile is the most detailed document.
- **Direction of mimesis is correctly identified.** The analysis knows who originated what.
- **Contested and uncontested zones are supported by market evidence** (surveys, trend data, sentiment analysis), not just by counting competitors.
- **Open positioning space is genuinely unoccupied,** not just theoretically available.
- **The tone is forensic and respectful.** The analysis delivers hard truths without being insulting or condescending.
- **Recommendations are concrete and actionable.** "Do X because of Y" rather than "consider exploring the possibility of Z."

### What Makes Output Bad

- **Lists of theoretical concepts** without execution against real data.
- **Treating the client as an afterthought** -- general observations while competitors get deep profiles.
- **Assuming the client is the imitator** without investigating the timeline.
- **Vague, aspirational language** ("desire propagation engine," "mimetic activation framework") that sounds impressive but means nothing.
- **Generic competitive analysis dressed in Girardian vocabulary.** The Girardian lens must produce DIFFERENT insights than a standard positioning matrix would. If the same conclusions could be reached without Girard, the lens is not being used properly.
- **Strategy recommendations that ignore real constraints.** "Just post daily on 5 platforms" when the client has a 3-person team.
- **Using AI training data instead of live research.** Competitor analysis must be current and verifiable.

## 7. Inputs Needed from the Client

### Minimum Input to Run Phase 1
1. **The client's brand/company name and website URL**
2. **A list of 10-20 competitors** (or permission for the AI to identify them)
3. **The client's product suite** with brief descriptions and price points
4. **The market/niche** they operate in (e.g., "AI for business owners," "B2B SaaS coaching")

### Optional But Valuable for Phase 1
- Links to the client's own sales pages, webinar recordings, or marketing materials
- The client's social media handles
- Any internal documents describing positioning, target audience, or brand values
- Historical context (when the business started, what concepts they originated, key milestones)

### Required for Phase 2
- Answers to the conversation questions listed in Section 5 above
