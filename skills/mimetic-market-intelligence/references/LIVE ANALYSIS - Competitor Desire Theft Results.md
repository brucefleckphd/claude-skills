# Competitor Desire Theft Analysis
## A Girardian Mimetic Map of the "AI for Business Owners" Market
### Produced February 21, 2026

---

## Section 1: The Desire Inventory

What follows is NOT a feature comparison. Each entry identifies the **desire being mediated** — the identity the buyer wants to inhabit, the person they want to become, the way they want to be seen. The competitor is the **model** (in Girard's language, the mediator) who makes that desire feel real and achievable.

---

### Alex Hormozi — Acquisition.com

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the ruthlessly competent operator — the person who has "figured out the game" and plays it with mathematical precision while everyone else flounders with emotion and guesswork.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to be seen as generous and above the money (giving away everything for free while being worth $100M+)
- The desire to be the "no-bullshit" person in a room full of hype
- The desire to belong to an elite tribe that "gets it" while the masses stay confused

**The Model Presented:** Hormozi himself — jacked, stoic, giving away free knowledge from a position of overwhelming abundance. The aspiration is: "I want to be the guy who's so far ahead he doesn't even need to sell."

**Evidence:**
- "Make offers so good people feel stupid saying no" — positions the buyer as the person with the unfair advantage
- The Value Equation (Dream Outcome x Likelihood / Time x Effort) — frames business as solvable math, not messy art
- His book launch generating $81M and a Guinness record — the model of abundance is the message itself
- "By invoking a movement to equip 32.5 million U.S. entrepreneurs with tools for unbreakable business models, Hormozi tapped into aspirational psychology, making participation feel altruistic and urgent"
- "You stop seeing yourself as the person who hesitates, and you start seeing yourself as the person who acts. That identity shift is where long-term success locks in."

### Sam Woods — Agent Operating System / Bionic Business

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the technical architect of a fully autonomous business — the person who built a "digital team" that operates without them.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to be early to the AI agent wave before the market catches on
- The desire to be seen as sophisticated and systems-minded, not a manual grinder
- The desire to have a "framework" that makes chaos feel orderly

**The Model Presented:** The calm engineer-CEO who has 40+ integrations humming in the background while they focus on strategy.

**Evidence:**
- "Agent Operating System 2026" — the word "operating system" implies you're building something permanent, architectural, not chasing tactics
- "Transforming isolated tools into a cohesive ecosystem of autonomous agents" — the buyer wants to be the person whose business runs itself through intelligence, not brute force
- "AI agents that actually work together like a digital team" — mediates the desire to replace human dependency with elegant automation

---

### Liam Ottley — AAA Accelerator

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be a young, fast-moving entrepreneur who caught the wave — the gold rush prospector who showed up first and staked the best claim.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to have a "real business" selling to other businesses (not another coaching gig)
- The desire to be technical without actually being an engineer (no-code/low-code)
- The desire for financial security dressed up as opportunity

**The Model Presented:** Ottley himself — young, confident, running a portfolio of AI companies. "If this 25-year-old can build an AI agency, so can I."

**Evidence:**
- "The AI gold rush is upon us. This group is for those who have realized the massive opportunity in selling AI solutions to businesses" — explicitly frames AI as a land grab
- "Start with zero technical skills" — mediates the desire to be technical without the pain of learning
- 280K+ Skool community members — the desire to belong to the biggest tribe in the space
- "Secure long-term job security" — underneath the gold-rush language, the real desire is safety

---

### Matt Wolfe — Future Tools

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the informed insider — the person who always knows what's new, what's coming, and what matters, before everyone else.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to feel calm and oriented while the world changes rapidly
- The desire to be the person friends and colleagues turn to for "what should I use?"
- The desire to be a curator, not a creator — elevated taste rather than grinding output

**The Model Presented:** The relaxed, nerdy guide who explores the frontier so you don't have to. Not threatening, not aspirational-wealth, just reliably ahead.

**Evidence:**
- FutureTools.io as a curation platform — the product IS being informed
- "Translating fast-moving developments into actionable insights" — mediates the desire to have the chaos made simple
- 460K YouTube subscribers consuming tools reviews — the audience wants to KNOW, not necessarily DO
- Newsletter model — the desire to passively stay current

---

### Iman Gadzhi — Educate / Monetise

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the self-made young mogul who escaped the system — dropped out, built empires, proved everyone wrong.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to have a "digital product empire" that generates money while you sleep
- The desire to use AI as a shortcut to skip the hard work others had to do
- The desire to be seen as sophisticated and global (eyewear brand, acquisitions, world travel)

**The Model Presented:** Gadzhi himself — the dropout who acquired Sam Ovens' Consulting.com, runs multiple brands, lives the international lifestyle.

**Evidence:**
- "Synthesise AI (AI tool that finds profitable niches and builds your entire digital product for you)" — the desire is to skip the thinking entirely
- "Ghostwriter OS (AI copywriter that creates all your sales pages, emails, and marketing materials)" — mediates the desire to have output without effort
- Acquiring Consulting.com — "this acquisition symbolized his arrival as a dominant player" — the desire is dominance and arrival

---

### Dan Martell — SaaS Academy / Buy Back Your Time

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the free CEO — the person who built a machine that runs without them, liberating their time for what matters (family, health, vision).

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to feel worthy of wealth (his messaging explicitly addresses self-worth)
- The desire to be a builder of systems, not a slave to them
- The desire to be the "grown-up" entrepreneur who's past the hustle phase

**The Model Presented:** Martell — recovered addict turned disciplined CEO, fit, present father, who built and sold multiple companies.

**Evidence:**
- "Don't hire to grow your business. Hire to buy back your time" — the desire is FREEDOM, not growth for growth's sake
- "You'll never get a penny more than you think you deserve. Your self-worth is a by-product of your identity" — directly mediating identity transformation
- "Get Unstuck, Reclaim Your Freedom, and Build Your Empire" — three desires in one subtitle: agency, freedom, legacy
- AI positioning is secondary — AI is framed as another lever for buying back time, not the main event

---

### Codie Sanchez — Contrarian Thinking

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the wise contrarian — the person who sees what others miss, who builds wealth quietly through "boring" businesses while the masses chase hype.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to be an insider who knows "the secret rich people know"
- The desire for meaning and community alongside wealth
- The desire to be the anti-guru — grounded, practical, Wall Street-smart

**The Model Presented:** Sanchez — ex-Wall Street, NYT bestseller, owns dozens of businesses. The "cool aunt" who tells you the truth.

**Evidence:**
- "Rich people know a secret" — mediates the desire to be initiated into hidden knowledge
- "Extraordinary wealth buying ordinary businesses" — the desire to be wise enough to see gold where others see garbage
- "It's not for slackers. It's for those who want meaning and fulfillment" — the desire to be serious, purposeful, above the hustle-bro culture
- "Paths paved with delusion and false promises" — positions AI/crypto chasers as the fools, her buyers as the wise

---

### Russell Brunson — ClickFunnels

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to belong to a tribe of winners (Two Comma Club, Inner Circle)
- The desire to have a system so good that selling becomes automatic
- The desire to be a movement leader, not just a business owner

**The Model Presented:** Brunson — the enthusiastic, relatable "regular guy" who discovered frameworks that work like magic.

- "Hook, Story, Offer" — the desire to have a repeatable formula that removes uncertainty
- Marketing.AI launch — "What previously took a day can now be done in less than an hour" — the desire is speed-to-result
- Five Day Lead Challenge — the desire to have transformation happen FAST

---

### Frank Kern — Frank Kern Inc.

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the effortlessly successful marketer — the laid-back genius who makes money while living the California lifestyle.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to have AI do all the work while you maintain the lifestyle
- The desire to be the insider who learned from the original internet marketing legends
- The desire for "your next million" (not your first — his audience already has some success)

**The Model Presented:** Kern — surfer-casual, decades of experience, still relevant, still making money with minimal visible effort.

**Evidence:**
- "I've literally replaced myself with AI, handing over all of my marketing work to AI after being a professional online direct response marketing copywriter and consultant for the past 26 years" — the desire to transcend work entirely
- "Your Next Million" podcast title — mediates the desire for continued, easy growth

- GoHighLevel Workshop — "land clients without ads, cold calls, or complicated tech" — the desire to skip all the hard parts

---

### Ryan Deiss — DigitalMarketer

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the legitimate, credentialed marketing professional — not a guru-follower but someone with REAL skills and systems.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to have marketing "handled" by a combination of AI and expert humans
- The desire to move past learning into implementation
- The desire to be current and not left behind as the industry shifts

**The Model Presented:** The institution (DigitalMarketer) more than the person — Deiss recently stepped back from courses entirely.

**Evidence:**
- "Multiplying the power of Artificial Intelligence with the power of Actual Intelligence" — mediates the desire to not be replaced by AI, but to USE it
- "Why pay for a course when AI can give you what you need instantly?" — his retirement message itself acknowledges the desire for shortcuts
- Pivot to services model — "so the important business of marketing actually gets DONE instead of just learned" — the desire is results, not knowledge

---

### Amy Porterfield — Digital Course Academy

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the independent expert with a course-based business — free from trading time for money, recognized as an authority.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire for a proven, step-by-step path (safety in a method)
- The desire to be "like Amy" — warm, successful, lifestyle freedom
- The desire to use AI as a helpful assistant rather than as the whole strategy

**The Model Presented:** Porterfield — the approachable, warm, "been there" mentor who made $100M+ from courses.

**Evidence:**
- "The only implementation program of its kind that shows you exactly how to create and market your digital course like a pro" — the desire to be a "pro," legitimate and credible
- "Custom-trained AI assistant that's like having a business coach in your back pocket" — AI is positioned as support, not replacement
- "9 figures in course sales" — the social proof mediates the desire: "if she did it, I can too"

---

### Chris Do — The Futur

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the creative professional who finally charges what they're worth — respected, valued, and paid premium prices.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to be articulate and confident in business conversations
- The desire to "unbland yourself" — to stand out through taste and thinking, not volume
- The desire to reconcile artistic identity with business success

**The Model Presented:** Do — the design world veteran who works with Nike and Starbucks but teaches openly.

**Evidence:**
- "I'll teach you to charge so much it makes your mom nervous" — mediates the desire for bold self-valuation
- "Value isn't determined by you, it's determined by the client" — the desire to see pricing as a skill, not a moral failing
- "DoBot" AI assistant — AI is positioned as extending Chris's wisdom, not replacing creative judgment
- "Unbland Yourself" — the desire to have a distinctive identity in a sea of sameness

---

### Myron Golden — High-Ticket Sales

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the person who commands premium prices through the power of their words and conviction — a Biblical-scale authority figure.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to master persuasion as a spiritual/moral gift, not manipulation
- The desire for massive, fast financial transformation

---

### Pedro Adao — 100X Academy

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be a "movement maker" — not just a business owner but a leader of a cause, someone whose work matters beyond revenue.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to have a proven launch mechanism (the challenge model) that reliably generates revenue
- The desire to be a "Kingdom Entrepreneur" — business as ministry
- The desire to replicate the success of the biggest names (Tony Robbins, Russell Brunson used his model)

**The Model Presented:** Adao — the faith-driven entrepreneur who created the system behind the biggest launches in the industry.

**Evidence:**
- "5-Day Movement Maker Challenge for Conscious Business Owners" — the desire isn't just profit, it's PURPOSE
- "The guy behind the massive online challenges run by Tony Robbins, Russell Brunson, Dean Graziosi, Grant Cardone" — the desire to be connected to greatness
- "$100+ million in revenue for himself and clientele in the past 12 months" — the desire for scale through a repeatable system

---

### Billy Gene — Billy Gene Is AI & XR Marketing

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be on the winning side of the AI revolution — the person who adapted, not the one who got left behind.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to make money from AI skills (agency model) rather than just use them
- The desire to be part of a massive community of early movers
- The desire for a specific, concrete income number ($302K/year, $2K/client/month)

**The Model Presented:** Billy Gene — the energetic, entertainment-driven marketer who's pivoted hard into AI.

**Evidence:**
- "The AI marketing revolution is rising. Which side of history will you be on? Tragedy or triumph?" — mediates fear of being left behind
- "Land $2K/month per client in 2026 as work-from-home social media managers using new AI agents" — the desire for a clear, achievable income path
- "175,000 students in 75 countries" — the desire to belong to a proven movement
- Rebranded from "Billy Gene Is Marketing" to "Billy Gene Is A.I. & XR Marketing" — the pivot IS the message

---

## Section 2: Contested Desire Zones

These are the desires where 5+ competitors are all fighting over the same mimetic territory. They are **saturated** — the market has heard these promises so many times they've become background noise.

### Contested Zone 1: "The Desire to Escape the Grind and Have Freedom While Your Business Grows"
**Competitors mediating this:** Hormozi, Sam Woods, Dan Martell, Frank Kern, Amy Porterfield, Russell Brunson, Iman Gadzhi
**Saturation level:** EXTREME. Every single one of these competitors promises some version of "your business runs without you." The specific mechanisms differ (AI agents, hiring, funnels, courses), but the underlying desire is identical. The market is numb to this promise.

### Contested Zone 2: "The Desire to Catch the AI Wave Before It's Too Late"
**Competitors mediating this:** Billy Gene, Liam Ottley, Sam Woods, Iman Gadzhi, Russell Brunson (Marketing.AI), Frank Kern
**Saturation level:** HIGH. The "AI gold rush" narrative is being run by at least 6 major competitors. The FOMO-based messaging ("which side of history will you be on?") is nearly identical across all of them. Buyers are becoming desensitized.

### Contested Zone 3: "The Desire to Have a Proven System/Framework That Makes Success Predictable"
**Competitors mediating this:** Hormozi (Value Equation), Russell Brunson (Hook-Story-Offer), Dan Martell (Buyback Principle), Pedro Adao (Challenge Model), Liam Ottley (6-Month Roadmap), Myron Golden (Make More Offers)
**Saturation level:** HIGH. Framework-selling is the default mode of every business educator. The market has seen so many "proven systems" that the phrase itself triggers skepticism.

### Contested Zone 4: "The Desire to Be Seen as Cutting-Edge and Ahead of Competitors"
**Competitors mediating this:** Matt Wolfe, Sam Woods, Liam Ottley, Billy Gene, Iman Gadzhi, Russell Brunson
**Saturation level:** MODERATE-HIGH. Being "ahead" is relative and fleeting. The market is starting to realize that "cutting edge" changes every 3 months, which creates desire fatigue.

### Contested Zone 5: "The Desire for a Specific, Achievable Income Target"
**Competitors mediating this:** Billy Gene ($302K/year), Liam Ottley (agency revenue), Iman Gadzhi ($10K/month), Myron Golden ($3.5M), Hormozi ($100M framing)
**Saturation level:** HIGH. Specific income claims are the oldest trick in internet marketing. The market has been promised "$10K months" for 15 years.

---

## Section 3: Underserved Desire Zones

These are desires that demonstrably exist in the market but that few or no competitors are explicitly mediating.

### Underserved Zone 1: "The Desire to Be the Wise Leader Who Understands WHAT to Do With AI, Not Just HOW to Use It"

**Evidence this desire exists:**
- AI anxiety now outranks economic concerns as the #1 business risk among US mid-market executives (Vistra survey)
- "Organizations are investing based on strategic necessity rather than proven returns" — 46% said they'd maintain AI investments even during a market correction, indicating decisions driven by fear, not understanding
- "Most entrepreneurs use AI like a spellchecker and then wonder why nothing changes" (Entrepreneur.com)
- The World Economic Forum reports CEOs are "all in on AI but anxieties remain" — the anxiety is not about tools, it's about JUDGMENT
- "AI fatigue is settling in as companies' proofs of concept fail" — people HAVE the tools but don't know what to DO with them

**Who's mediating this:** Almost nobody. Hormozi comes closest with his systems-thinking approach, but even he focuses on offers and leads, not strategic judgment. Matt Wolfe curates tools but doesn't teach thinking. The market is flooded with "how to use ChatGPT" and starved of "how to THINK about what AI means for YOUR specific business."

**Gap severity:** SEVERE. This is the single largest uncontested desire in the market.

### Underserved Zone 2: "The Desire to Not Feel Stupid or Left Behind — Without Having to Become Technical"

**Evidence this desire exists:**
- FOBO (Fear of Becoming Obsolete) identified as a rising phenomenon — "the creeping sense that your skills are degrading in real time, that you're falling behind faster than you can catch up"
- 64% of professionals globally feel "overwhelmed by the current pace of change at work"
- AI for Business workshops exist specifically "for business owners who want to grow with AI but don't know where to start or feel overwhelmed"
- Stack Overflow research shows AI tools are creating imposter syndrome even among developers — the effect is far worse for non-technical business owners

**Who's mediating this:** Amy Porterfield (gently), but she frames AI as a helper within her existing course model. Nobody is directly saying: "You're not stupid. The tools are confusing because the THINKING is missing. Let me give you the thinking."

**Gap severity:** HIGH. The emotional reality of most business owners is shame and confusion about AI. Nobody is speaking to it directly and compassionately.

### Underserved Zone 3: "The Desire to Be a Strategic Thinker, Not a Tactician — to See Connections Others Miss"

**Evidence this desire exists:**
- Chris Do touches this with creatives ("unbland yourself"), but only for designers/agencies
- Codie Sanchez touches it with "contrarian thinking," but applies it to business acquisition, not AI strategy
- The most viral business content consistently involves "connecting dots" that others don't see — pattern recognition content outperforms tactical content
- Entrepreneurs express deep frustration with "which tool should I use?" because they know the real question is "what strategy should I pursue?"

**Who's mediating this:** Nobody in the AI-for-business space. This is the classic "strategist vs. tactician" positioning that Rich Schefren pioneered with the Internet Business Manifesto — but nobody has updated it for the AI era.

**Gap severity:** HIGH. The desire to be a strategic thinker is perennial and intensifies during periods of rapid change when tactics become obsolete faster.

### Underserved Zone 4: "The Desire to Build Something That Lasts — Not Chase Another Wave"

**Evidence this desire exists:**
- Codie Sanchez's success with "boring businesses" proves the counter-hype desire is real and large
- Ryan Deiss literally retired from course-selling, saying "Why pay for a course when AI can give you what you need instantly?" — the market is questioning the permanence of current models
- AI fatigue articles describe companies that invested in "proofs of concept" that failed — the desire for substance over flash is growing
- The contrast between "AI gold rush" language (Liam Ottley) and actual business owner sentiment shows a gap between what's sold and what's wanted

**Who's mediating this:** Codie Sanchez (for business acquisition). Dan Martell (partially, for SaaS). Nobody for AI-integrated business strategy that prioritizes durability.

**Gap severity:** MODERATE-HIGH. This desire grows as AI hype fatigue sets in.

### Underserved Zone 5: "The Desire to Have AI Amplify MY Unique Genius, Not Replace My Thinking With Generic Output"

**Evidence this desire exists:**
- Chris Do's "unbland yourself" resonates because creatives feel AI is making everything same-y
- The entire "AI slop" backlash (Fortune, late 2025) reflects consumer and creator disgust at generic AI output
- Business owners who've tried ChatGPT for marketing describe the output as "fine but sounds like everyone else"
- The desire for personalization and uniqueness is the opposite of what most AI tools deliver

**Who's mediating this:** Nobody directly. This is the gap between "use AI to do more" (what everyone sells) and "use AI to be MORE YOURSELF" (what people actually want).

**Gap severity:** HIGH. This desire will only intensify as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent and undifferentiated.

---

## Section 4: Rich's Current Desire Position

Based on Rich Schefren's actual marketing presence (Strategic Profits, richschefren.com, Force Multiplier, Connect the Dots):

### What Rich Currently Mediates

**Primary desire:** The desire to be a strategic thinker who sees the game at a higher level than competitors — the "coach to the gurus," the person behind the curtain.

**Supporting desires:**
- The desire to graduate from "opportunity seeker" to "strategic entrepreneur" (the original Internet Business Manifesto positioning)
- The desire for AI to serve STRATEGY, not replace thinking
- The desire to "connect the dots" that others can't see

### Assessment

Rich is positioned in an **underserved zone** — but his marketing doesn't fully exploit it. Here's the gap:

1. **The "strategist" positioning is RIGHT but underleveraged.** The Internet Business Manifesto's "opportunity seeker vs. strategic entrepreneur" distinction is MORE relevant now than when he wrote it — because the AI era has created millions of new opportunity seekers chasing the latest tool. But the messaging hasn't been forcefully updated for 2025-2026.

2. **"Connect the Dots" is a brilliant product name that mediates a real desire** — the desire to be the pattern-recognizer, the person who sees what others miss. But it's not visible enough in the broader market.

3. **"Force Multiplier" mediates the desire for leverage** — but "force multiplier" is a military/physics metaphor that may not emotionally land the way "buy back your time" or "boring businesses" does. The desire it mediates (amplification of existing capability) is real but the language may be too abstract.

4. **Rich's biggest asset is his ABSENCE from the contested zones.** He's not promising gold rushes, $10K months, or "catch the wave." This is either a positioning advantage (genuinely different) or a visibility problem (nobody knows he exists). Currently, it's closer to the latter.

---

## Section 5: The Opportunity Map

### Opportunity 1: "The AI Strategist" — Mediate the Desire to Be the Person Who Knows WHAT to Do With AI (Not Just How to Use It)

**Why it's real:** This is Underserved Zone 1. Every data point screams this desire exists — CEOs investing out of fear, entrepreneurs using AI "like a spellchecker," companies with AI fatigue from failed proofs of concept. The market is drowning in tools and starving for judgment.

**Why nobody else is there:** Every competitor is selling tools, frameworks, or speed. Nobody is selling THINKING. This is exactly Rich's original positioning updated for AI.

**The mimetic opportunity:** Rich becomes the model for "the entrepreneur who thinks clearly while everyone else reacts to hype." The buyer wants to be the CALM one in the room who sees what others miss. This is the opposite of "AI gold rush" energy — it's "I understand what this means for MY business, specifically."

**Suggested language territory:** "Everyone is teaching you AI tools. Nobody is teaching you AI thinking." / "The tool isn't the advantage. The person using it is." / "AI doesn't replace strategy. It punishes the lack of it."

### Opportunity 2: "The Anti-Generic" — Mediate the Desire to Have AI Amplify Uniqueness, Not Erase It

**Why it's real:** This is Underserved Zone 5. The "AI slop" backlash is real. Business owners who've used ChatGPT for a year are realizing their marketing sounds like everyone else's. The desire to stand out is getting HARDER, not easier, as AI commoditizes output.

**Why nobody else is there:** The entire market is positioned around "AI does more, faster." Nobody is positioned around "AI makes you MORE YOU." Rich's AI Imprint Challenge actually touches this territory — AI personalization — but the messaging could be sharper.

**The mimetic opportunity:** Rich becomes the model for "the entrepreneur whose AI output is distinctly theirs." The buyer doesn't want to sound like ChatGPT. They want to sound like a BETTER version of themselves.

**Suggested language territory:** "AI that sounds like you, not like everyone else." / "The problem isn't that AI can't write. The problem is it writes the same thing for everyone." / "Your competitive advantage isn't AI. It's YOU — amplified by AI."

### Opportunity 3: "The Shame-Free Guide" — Mediate the Desire to Stop Feeling Stupid About AI

**Why it's real:** This is Underserved Zone 2. FOBO is real. 64% of professionals feel overwhelmed. Business owners are making investment decisions out of FEAR, not understanding. The emotional reality is shame — "I should understand this by now, and I don't" — and nobody is speaking to it directly.

**Why nobody else is there:** Every competitor's messaging assumes the buyer is excited about AI. Hormozi assumes competence. Liam Ottley assumes ambition. Billy Gene assumes eagerness. Nobody says: "It's okay that you're confused. The confusion isn't your fault. Let me give you the clarity."

**The mimetic opportunity:** Rich becomes the model for "the experienced entrepreneur who was initially confused by AI but developed the thinking framework to make it simple." This is the empathetic authority position — not the 25-year-old teaching you AI, but the 20+ year strategist who ALSO had to figure it out.

**Suggested language territory:** "You're not behind. You're being sold confusion by people who profit from your urgency." / "AI isn't hard. It's been poorly explained — on purpose." / "The gurus want you overwhelmed. That's how they sell you the next course."

### Opportunity 4: "The Durable Builder" — Mediate the Desire to Build Something That Outlasts the AI Hype Cycle

**Why it's real:** This is Underserved Zone 4. As AI tools change every 90 days, building on specific tools feels like building on sand. Business owners who've been through previous hype cycles (social media, crypto, NFTs) are wary. They want something that LASTS.

**Why nobody else is there:** The entire AI education market is built on novelty and urgency. "Act now before it changes!" is the universal message. Nobody is saying: "Build something that still works when the next wave hits."

**The mimetic opportunity:** Rich becomes the model for "the entrepreneur who builds on principles, not platforms." This connects directly to his strategist positioning and his 20-year track record — proof that strategic thinking outlasts every tactical cycle.

**Suggested language territory:** "Tools change. Thinking doesn't." / "Everyone who built on the last 'revolution' is rebuilding right now. You don't have to." / "The entrepreneurs who win in AI are the same ones who would have won without it — because they think correctly."

### Opportunity 5: "The Pattern Recognizer" — Mediate the Desire to See Connections Others Can't

**Why it's real:** This is Underserved Zone 3 and it maps directly to "Connect the Dots." The desire to be a pattern-recognizer is one of the deepest entrepreneurial desires — it's what separates the founder from the employee, the strategist from the tactician. In the AI era, pattern recognition across domains is the ONE thing humans still do better than machines.

**Why nobody else is there:** Competitors sell single-domain expertise (marketing, agencies, SaaS, sales). Nobody sells CROSS-DOMAIN THINKING — the ability to see how changes in AI, markets, culture, and technology interact to create opportunities.

**The mimetic opportunity:** Rich becomes the model for "the person who sees the whole board while everyone else stares at their one piece." Connect the Dots literally IS this product. The opportunity is to make this positioning louder and more central.

**Suggested language territory:** "The money isn't in the tools. It's in the connections between them." / "Specialists know their domain. Strategists see across all of them." / "AI gives everyone access to the same information. The advantage goes to whoever connects it differently."

---

## Summary: Rich's Strategic Position

Rich Schefren sits in the most defensible position in this market — but it's also the least visible. Here's the core tension:

**Every other competitor is mediating desires that are LOUD but CONTESTED.** Gold rushes, freedom, income targets, proven systems. These desires are easy to activate but impossible to differentiate on.

**Rich mediates desires that are QUIET but UNCONTESTED.** Strategic thinking, pattern recognition, durable principles, AI as amplifier of uniqueness. These desires are harder to activate but impossible to compete with once established.

The strategic question is not "what should Rich sell?" — the products (Force Multiplier, Connect the Dots, AI Imprint) already map to the underserved zones. The question is: **how does Rich make the quiet desires LOUD?**

The Girardian answer: you need a sharper model. The buyer needs to see, viscerally, the PERSON they want to become by working with Rich. Not "a strategist" in the abstract — but a specific, visible, aspirational identity that contrasts sharply with what every other competitor offers.

The contrast: "They'll teach you to use AI tools. I'll teach you to THINK — so no tool, no wave, no hype cycle ever makes you feel behind again."
