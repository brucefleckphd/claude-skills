## Part 1: The Desire Profile

### Rich Schefren — Strategic Profits

**Primary Desire Mediated:** The desire to be the strategic thinker who sees the game at a higher level than everyone else -- the person who understands WHY things work while competitors chase WHAT works. The buyer wants to inhabit the identity of "the one who gets it" while others scramble.

**Secondary Desires:**
- The desire to graduate from "opportunity seeker" to "strategic entrepreneur" -- to stop chasing tactics and start operating from vision
- The desire to have AI amplify your UNIQUE thinking rather than replace it with generic output (the "Imprint" concept)
- The desire to overcome internal self-sabotage and finally close the knowing-doing gap -- to become the person who executes, not just the person who knows
- The desire to be connected to legitimacy and proven results (the "guru to the gurus" credibility halo)

**The Model Presented:** Rich himself -- the strategist behind the names the market already trusts (Brunson, Kern, Deiss, Walker). The aspiration is: "I want to think like the guy who taught the gurus how to think." Rich functions as a second-order model -- you don't just want to be like Rich, you want to be like the VERSION of yourself that Rich's thinking would produce.

**Evidence:**

1. **X/Twitter bio:** "I Teach Entrepreneurs How To Have More Money, More Business, More Time Off" -- three desires in one line, but notably abstract and benefit-driven rather than identity-driven.

2. **Force Multiplier webinar copy:** "Force Multiplier is not another 'how to use ChatGPT' workshop... 10 days of building real systems, with Rich and his team, on your actual business" -- explicitly differentiates from the tactical crowd. The desire mediated is: "I want to be the person who builds SYSTEMS, not the person who follows tutorials."

3. **Force Multiplier positioning:** "Rich Schefren -- creator of the automated webinar, and the strategist behind Kern, Brunson, Walker, and Deiss" -- the credibility claim mediates the desire to learn from the SOURCE, not the derivatives.

4. **LinkedIn post:** "People Aren't Buying Info Anymore. They're Buying AI" -- positions Rich as the one who sees the paradigm shift before others. The desire: "I want to be the person who understands WHERE the market is going, not the person still selling yesterday's model."

5. **LinkedIn post:** "They were business builders. Carnegie. Ford. Gates. They used the technology available to them. You don't need to master AI" -- mediates the desire to be a BUILDER who uses AI, not a technician who serves AI. Historical framing elevates the identity.

6. **X/Twitter post:** "How we flipped a losing webinar into a money-making machine without changing a thing... Most people ditch the campaign. We changed the objective. We plugged in a self-liquidating offer (a low-ticket book) before the webinar -- and told the ad platform to optimize for buyers instead" -- mediates the desire to be the strategist who sees the non-obvious solution while others give up.

7. **X/Twitter post:** "Most people start with a grand vision. Me? I start with something real. Something that works. And then I explore every possible way to maximize its value... Because real success isn't about rigid plans. It's about adapting, seizing opportunities, and removing friction so entrepreneurs and marketers can grow FAST" -- mediates the desire to be pragmatic and adaptive rather than rigidly ideological.

8. **Internet Business Manifesto subtitle:** "A Big Business Was Just A Small Business That Did The Right Things. A Wealthy Business Owner Was An Opportunity Seeker Who Became An Entrepreneur" -- the foundational desire: transformation from one identity (seeker) to another (entrepreneur). This is pure Girardian mimetic desire -- the document NAMES the identity you're currently stuck in and shows you the identity you want to inhabit.

9. **Russell Brunson Show appearance (Dec 2025):** "Rich Schefren Reveals the AI System That Eliminates Self-Sabotage and Accelerates Growth" -- mediates the desire to have technology solve your INTERNAL problems, not just external ones. The desire: "I want to be the person who finally overcame the patterns holding me back."

10. **ZenithMind OS marketing:** "A groundbreaking AI-powered system designed to help entrepreneurs bridge the knowing-doing gap by deeply understanding their internal patterns and eliminating self-sabotage" -- mediates the desire for self-mastery, not just business mastery.

## Part 2: Desire Mediation Strengths

### Strength 1: The "Strategist Behind the Strategists" Positioning Is Unmatched

No competitor in the market can make this claim. When Rich's marketing says he is "the strategist behind Kern, Brunson, Walker, and Deiss," he is not just establishing credibility -- he is creating a SECOND-ORDER desire structure that is uniquely powerful in Girardian terms.

Here is why: Girard distinguishes between models who are desired directly ("I want to be like Hormozi") and models who are desired because they PRODUCE other models ("I want to learn from the person who MADE Hormozi-level people"). Rich occupies the rare position of being a model-of-models. The prospect does not just want to be like Rich -- they want ACCESS to the thinking that created the people they already admire.

**Evidence:** "He's the only consultant on the planet with a $1 billion dollar testimonial for his work with Agora Publishing, and in total has been responsible for his clients raking in an additional $15 Billion in increased sales, all of it documented."

This is structurally superior to any competitor's credibility claim. Hormozi can claim $100M in personal wealth. Rich can claim $15B in client results. The mimetic power of this distinction is enormous -- but it is buried in bios and third-party descriptions rather than being the lead message.

### Strength 2: The "Opportunity Seeker vs. Entrepreneur" Distinction Is the Most Powerful Identity Wedge in the Market

The Internet Business Manifesto's core distinction -- "An opportunity seeker is always looking for their big opportunity to make lots of money from the hot opportunity of the moment... A true entrepreneur is a completely different animal altogether" -- is perhaps the single most effective mimetic device in the history of internet marketing education.

Why it works in Girardian terms: It NAMES the undesirable identity (opportunity seeker) in a way that creates immediate shame-based motivation. Nobody wants to be the person who "buys lots of products, uses only a few of them, and abandons the ones they do use when the next so-called 'easy' way to make money comes by." The prospect reads this and thinks: "That's me. I don't want to be that anymore."

This is textbook Girard: desire is activated not by showing someone what to want, but by showing them what they currently ARE -- and making it intolerable. The Manifesto does this better than anything Hormozi, Brunson, or anyone else has ever produced.

**The problem:** This distinction was written for a pre-AI market. It has not been forcefully restated for the current era, where "opportunity seeking" looks like chasing every new AI tool, and "strategic entrepreneurship" looks like knowing WHAT to build with AI and WHY. The raw material is there. The update is not.

### Strength 3: The "Knowing-Doing Gap" Addresses the Desire Nobody Else Touches

ZenithMind OS's positioning around self-sabotage and internal pattern recognition mediates a desire that no other competitor in this market addresses directly: the desire to stop being your own worst enemy.

Rich's marketing says he "kept journals for 29 years documenting his own internal conflicts" and is "brutally honest about his own struggles with self-sabotage, procrastination, and that knowing-doing gap, despite knowing all the 'right' business moves."

In Girardian terms, this is powerful because it removes the external mediator problem. Most business education says: "The reason you're not succeeding is you lack the RIGHT strategy/tool/framework." Rich's ZenithMind positioning says: "You already HAVE the right strategy. The problem is YOU." This is a completely different desire structure -- the desire is not for information but for TRANSFORMATION of the self.

### Strength 4: The Tactical Posts Show a Master Practitioner

Posts like the self-liquidating offer webinar pivot and the "Not everyone loves webinars -- don't stop selling, repurpose it" advice demonstrate something competitors cannot fake: deep operational fluency. These are not theory posts. They are the observations of someone who has run campaigns for 20 years and sees patterns others miss.

This mediates the desire to learn from someone who is STILL IN THE GAME, not someone teaching from a book they wrote five years ago.

## Part 3: Desire Mediation Gaps

### Gap 1: The Model Is Invisible -- Rich as Aspirational Figure Is Nearly Absent

**What Girard says should happen:** The prospect needs a MODEL -- a visible, concrete representation of the person they want to become. The model must be seen repeatedly, in enough detail and proximity, that the prospect begins to FEEL what it would be like to be that person.

**What actually happens:** Rich's public-facing presence is thin compared to every major competitor. There is no consistent YouTube presence with regular uploads. His X/Twitter posts are sporadic and often tactical tips rather than identity-building content. His LinkedIn posts are intermittent. There is no Substack or newsletter with a public archive. There is no podcast of his own with regular episodes.

Compare: Hormozi posts daily across 5+ platforms with a consistent visual identity. Brunson has a daily podcast plus YouTube. Codie Sanchez has 1.5M+ social followers built organically. Dan Martell has a bestselling book and a YouTube channel with hundreds of videos.

**The mimetic consequence:** You cannot desire to be like someone you cannot see. Girard's theory requires EXPOSURE to the model. If Rich posts once a week on X with a tactical tip, the prospect never develops the sustained mimetic relationship required for high-ticket desire formation. The prospect cannot want to "think like Rich" if they never see Rich thinking.

**Severity:** CRITICAL. This is the single largest structural gap. Rich has the strongest credibility claim in the market ("the strategist behind the strategists") but the weakest visibility. The model is hidden behind a curtain -- and while that creates mystique, it does not create DESIRE at scale.

### Gap 2: The Identity Transformation Is Implicit, Not Explicit

**What Girard says should happen:** The marketing should make the identity transformation explicit. The prospect should see: "This is who you are now (undesirable). This is who you will become (desirable). Here is the model who has already made this transformation or who can guide it."

**What actually happens:** Rich's current marketing tells you WHAT you will learn or build (AI systems, strategic thinking, self-awareness) but rarely tells you WHO you will become. Compare:

- **Hormozi:** "You stop seeing yourself as the person who hesitates, and you start seeing yourself as the person who acts. That identity shift is where long-term success locks in." -- EXPLICIT identity shift.
- **Brunson:** "Two Comma Club" -- your identity changes when you cross the threshold. You become a "Two Comma Club" member. EXPLICIT new identity.
- **Codie Sanchez:** You become "the contrarian" -- the wise person who buys what others overlook. EXPLICIT new identity.
- **Rich:** "I Teach Entrepreneurs How To Have More Money, More Business, More Time Off" -- three OUTCOMES but no IDENTITY. Who does the buyer BECOME? A "strategic entrepreneur"? A "force multiplier"? A "dot connector"? The identity is never named and never crystallized.

**The mimetic consequence:** Without a named identity destination, the desire remains diffuse. The prospect can feel generally attracted to Rich's thinking but cannot point to a specific version of themselves they are working toward. This reduces urgency, weakens community formation, and makes word-of-mouth harder ("I'm in Rich's program" vs. "I'm a Two Comma Club member" -- the latter carries an identity, the former does not).

**Severity:** HIGH. The Internet Business Manifesto DID this brilliantly with "opportunity seeker vs. entrepreneur." But current marketing does not carry forward a clear identity label.

### Gap 3: The Product Architecture Fragments the Desire Rather Than Focusing It

**What Girard says should happen:** There should be a clear desire path -- a single, coherent mimetic structure that takes the prospect from "I am NOT like the model" to "I am BECOMING like the model" to "I AM the model."

**What actually happens:** The current product suite sends multiple, potentially conflicting desire signals:

- **Force Multiplier** mediates the desire for AI operational leverage ("your 6-person team operates like 6,000")
- **ZenithMind OS** mediates the desire for self-mastery and pattern interruption ("eliminate self-sabotage")
- **Connect the Dots** mediates the desire for strategic thinking ("see what others miss")
- **Steal Our Winners** mediates the desire to be an informed insider ("the best strategies from the best marketers")
- **AI Imprint Challenge** mediates the desire for AI personalization ("AI that sounds like you")

These are five different desire structures pointing in five different directions. A prospect encountering Rich's marketing cannot quickly answer: "What is the ONE desire this brand mediates?" Hormozi = competent operator. Brunson = marketing genius with a system. Codie = wise contrarian. Rich = ???

**The mimetic consequence:** Fragmented desire is weak desire. When the prospect has to choose which version of Rich's world to enter, the mimetic energy dissipates. The strongest brands have ONE primary desire with products that represent stages of that desire (beginner -> intermediate -> advanced), not different desires entirely.

**Severity:** HIGH. This is partly a messaging problem and partly a product architecture problem. The underlying thread connecting all five products IS there (it is something like "the strategically self-aware entrepreneur who uses AI as an amplifier of their unique genius"). But it has never been explicitly articulated as a unified desire arc.

### Gap 4: Social Proof Functions as Credibility, Not as Mimetic Modeling

**What Girard says should happen:** Testimonials and case studies should function as INTERNAL MEDIATORS -- peers of the prospect who have already made the transformation. The prospect should look at these people and think: "They were like me. Now they're like THAT. I want what they have."

**What actually happens:** Rich's social proof is heavily weighted toward EXTERNAL mediation -- famous names (Brunson, Kern, Agora) rather than relatable peers. The "$15 billion in client results" claim is stunning but abstract. The prospect cannot see themselves in Agora Publishing.

Compare: Hormozi's marketing is FILLED with gym owners, agency founders, and small business operators who went from $50K to $500K. These are internal mediators -- close enough to the prospect that mimetic desire activates automatically. Brunson's "Two Comma Club" wall of winners does the same thing.

Rich's marketing mentions "thousands of success stories and hundreds of million-dollar businesses" but does not make them visible, named, and story-driven in the public marketing.

**Severity:** MODERATE-HIGH. The credibility is real but the mimetic structure is wrong for desire activation. Famous-name social proof creates AUTHORITY. Peer social proof creates DESIRE. Rich has the former but under-deploys the latter.

### Gap 5: The Language Is Professor-Mode, Not Preacher-Mode

**What Girard says should happen:** Mimetic desire is activated through EMOTIONAL resonance, not intellectual accuracy. The language should make the prospect FEEL something -- shame at their current state, excitement about the transformation, urgency about the window closing.

**What actually happens:** Rich's public language tends toward the analytical and explanatory. Consider these samples:

- "A groundbreaking AI-powered system designed to help entrepreneurs bridge the knowing-doing gap by deeply understanding their internal patterns"
- "Strategic distinctions, tailored tactics and key connections that solve specific problems"
- "Every strategy is hand-selected by Rich Schefren and only included if the tactic delivers measurable ROI fast"

These are accurate descriptions but they do not CREATE DESIRE. They appeal to the rational mind. Compare:

- **Hormozi:** "Make offers so good people feel stupid saying no" -- you FEEL the power.
- **Brunson:** "The Last Secret" -- you FEEL the curiosity and FOMO.
- **Codie Sanchez:** "Rich people know a secret" -- you FEEL the exclusion and want IN.
- **Rich:** "Strategic distinctions, tailored tactics and key connections" -- you UNDERSTAND the value but you do not FEEL the desire.

**Severity:** MODERATE. The analytical voice is authentic to Rich and part of his brand. The fix is not to become someone he is not, but to layer emotional activation ONTO the analytical framework. The Internet Business Manifesto actually did this -- it was intellectually rigorous AND emotionally activating. Current marketing has drifted toward the intellectual pole.

## Part 4: The Model Problem

### External vs. Internal Mediation

Girard distinguishes between **external mediation** (the model is distant, unreachable, godlike) and **internal mediation** (the model is close, accessible, potentially a rival).

Rich currently occupies an awkward middle ground:

- **He is positioned as external mediator** through the "guru to the gurus" framing, the $15B in client results, the Agora billion-dollar testimonial. This creates AUTHORITY and REVERENCE but not DESIRE. You admire an external mediator. You do not try to become them -- they feel too distant.

- **He occasionally functions as internal mediator** through tactical posts (the webinar pivot, the SOW episodes) and through vulnerability (the 29 years of journal-keeping, the self-sabotage confession). These moments make him accessible and relatable.

The problem: these two modes fight each other. The "guru to the gurus" positioning says "I am above you." The self-sabotage vulnerability says "I struggle like you." Both are true, but in marketing, they create cognitive dissonance unless they are explicitly reconciled with a narrative like: "I am the person who struggled exactly like you -- AND became the strategist the gurus turn to. Here is how I made that journey, and here is how you can too."

That reconciliation narrative does not exist in Rich's current public marketing.

### The Desire Triangle

In Girard's framework, mimetic desire always involves three elements:

**Subject (Prospect):** An entrepreneur who suspects they are operating below their potential -- they have information, tools, maybe even revenue, but they lack the THINKING that would tie it all together. They are haunted by the gap between what they know and what they do.

**Model (Rich / Successful Student):** This is where the structure breaks down. Rich SHOULD be the model, but his visibility is too low for sustained mimetic identification. And there are almost no visible STUDENT models functioning as internal mediators (peers who made the transformation).

**Object (What is desired):** Here is the critical ambiguity. What EXACTLY does the prospect want through Rich? The answer should be singular and clear. Candidates:

- Strategic clarity (the ability to see what others miss)
- Self-mastery (overcoming internal blocks)
- AI leverage (systems that multiply capability)
- Market position (being ahead of competitors)

All four are real. None has been chosen as THE primary object of desire. Until one is chosen and the others subordinated, the desire triangle remains unfocused.

### Recommendation for the Desire Triangle

The strongest candidate for the primary Object is: **"The ability to THINK at a level that makes everything else -- AI, tactics, scaling, competition -- simple."**

This unifies all four candidates:
- Strategic clarity IS this thinking
- Self-mastery is a prerequisite for clear thinking
- AI leverage is a consequence of clear thinking (knowing WHAT to build)
- Market position is a natural result of out-thinking competitors

And it maps directly to Rich's actual superpower -- the thing even his competitors acknowledge he does better than anyone.

## Part 5: Comparison to Top Competitors

### Side-by-Side Mimetic Analysis

| Dimension | Rich Schefren | Alex Hormozi | Russell Brunson | Dan Martell | Codie Sanchez |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Primary Desire** | Think at a higher level | Be the ruthlessly competent operator | Be the marketing genius with the system | Be the free CEO who bought back time | Be the wise contrarian who sees what others miss |
| **Identity Label** | None (implicit "strategist") | "Acquisition entrepreneur" | "Two Comma Club member" / "Funnel Hacker" | "Buyback CEO" | "Contrarian Thinker" |
| **Model Visibility** | LOW -- sporadic social, no regular show | EXTREME -- daily omnipresence across platforms | HIGH -- daily podcast, regular YouTube, live events | HIGH -- bestselling book, active YouTube, speaking | HIGH -- 1.5M+ followers, newsletter, constant content |
| **Social Proof Type** | External (famous names, $15B claim) | Internal (gym owners, agency founders -- peers) | Internal (Two Comma Club wall, challenge winners) | Internal (SaaS founders scaling) | Internal (business buyers succeeding) |
| **Emotional Activation** | Low-moderate (analytical, professor tone) | High (bold, confident, mathematical certainty) | Very high (storytelling, frameworks, urgency) | High (personal story of recovery, family values) | High (contrarian energy, "boring is beautiful" surprise) |
| **Desire Clarity** | Fragmented across 5 products | Single: build offers that scale | Single: funnels that convert | Single: buy back your time | Single: buy boring businesses for wealth |
| **Credibility Depth** | Deepest in the market (originated concepts others teach) | Strong but newer (decade of track record) | Strong and visible (ClickFunnels as proof) | Strong (multiple exits, bestseller) | Strong (Wall Street + portfolio of businesses) |

### Where Rich Wins in Mimetic Terms

1. **Credibility depth is unassailable.** No competitor can claim to have originated the automated webinar, popularized the VSL, created the lead magnet concept, and coached the market's biggest names. Rich's credibility is not "I made money" -- it is "I made the INDUSTRY." This is a structural advantage no amount of content volume can replicate.

2. **The strategic thinking desire is genuinely underserved.** As documented in the Competitor Desire Theft analysis, "The Desire to Be the Wise Leader Who Understands WHAT to Do With AI, Not Just HOW to Use It" is the single largest uncontested desire in the market. Rich is the natural owner of this territory. Nobody else can credibly claim it.

3. **The self-mastery angle (ZenithMind) is a unique desire vector.** No competitor addresses internal psychology as a core product. Hormozi talks about identity shifts in passing. Dan Martell touches on self-worth. But nobody has built a PRODUCT around "your internal patterns are the bottleneck." Rich has.

### Where Rich Loses in Mimetic Terms

1. **Visibility is not competitive.** In Girardian terms, a model who is not seen cannot generate desire. Hormozi generates more mimetic energy in a single day of content than Rich generates in a month. The quality of Rich's thinking may be higher, but desire does not care about quality -- it cares about EXPOSURE to the model.

2. **Desire clarity loses to every major competitor.** Every competitor listed above can be summarized in one sentence. Rich cannot. This is the single most damaging mimetic weakness because it prevents word-of-mouth ("What does Rich Schefren do?" should have a one-sentence answer that ACTIVATES desire, and it currently does not).

3. **The identity destination is unnamed.** "Two Comma Club member" is a thing you can BE. "Funnel Hacker" is a thing you can BE. "Contrarian Thinker" is a thing you can BE. There is no equivalent label in Rich's ecosystem. "Strategic Profits member" is not an identity -- it is a subscription.

4. **Internal mediators (peer success stories) are invisible.** The market sees that Rich coached Brunson and Kern, but those are external mediators too far above the prospect to activate desire. Where are the "normal" entrepreneurs who went through Force Multiplier and had their thinking transformed? They may exist, but they are not visible in public marketing.

## Part 6: What Would Make This Section as Strong as the Competitor Sections

### The Honest Assessment

The competitor sections in the Desire Theft analysis benefit from an abundance of publicly visible marketing material. Hormozi has thousands of social posts, multiple books, and a media machine producing content daily. Brunson has a decade of webinars, a daily podcast, and an entire platform (ClickFunnels) that IS the marketing. Codie Sanchez has 1.5M+ followers and a newsletter with a public archive.

Rich Schefren has:
- A personal website (richschefren.com) with limited public-facing copy
- A Strategic Profits website that functions more as a member portal than a marketing asset
- Sporadic X/Twitter posts (roughly weekly, sometimes less)
- Intermittent LinkedIn posts
- No regular podcast of his own (guest appearances only)
- No regular YouTube uploads
- No Substack or public newsletter archive
- Sales pages (Force Multiplier, ZenithMind OS, SOW) that are behind registration walls or limited-time
- The Internet Business Manifesto (2007-era) and Attention Age Doctrine (2008-era) as foundational but dated public documents

**This scarcity of public marketing material IS the finding.** It is not a research failure -- it is the core diagnostic. Rich has the deepest credibility, the strongest origin story, and the most defensible positioning in the market. But the MARKETING OF THAT POSITIONING is nearly invisible compared to competitors.

### What Would Need to Exist for a Truly Complete Profile

1. **A consistent, public content engine** -- regular posts across 2-3 platforms that build sustained mimetic exposure. Currently, a researcher trying to understand Rich's desire structure has to piece it together from scattered posts, old manifestos, and third-party descriptions. Competitors' desire structures are immediately obvious from 5 minutes on their social media.

2. **A public-facing sales page for the flagship offer** that stays live (not behind webinar registration). Force Multiplier's copy appears to be excellent based on fragments, but it is only visible during launch windows. Hormozi's offers page, Brunson's ClickFunnels page, and Codie's Contrarian Thinking landing page are permanently visible and permanently mediating desire.

3. **Visible student transformation stories** in public marketing (not just inside the community). Case studies with names, before/after narratives, and specific results that function as internal mediators.

4. **A named identity for the buyer.** Something equivalent to "Funnel Hacker" or "Two Comma Club member" that Rich's buyers can adopt as a label for WHO THEY ARE BECOMING.

5. **An updated manifesto.** The Internet Business Manifesto was the most powerful piece of mimetic marketing in the industry's history. Its core distinction (opportunity seeker vs. strategic entrepreneur) is MORE relevant today than in 2007. An updated version -- "The AI Business Manifesto" or equivalent -- would instantly reclaim the territory Rich originated and do so at a level no competitor can match.

---

## Summary: The Paradox of the Pioneer

Rich Schefren faces a uniquely Girardian problem: he is the ORIGINATOR of concepts that his competitors now use to mediate desire, but his own marketing of those concepts has been outpaced by the very people he taught.

The "opportunity seeker vs. entrepreneur" distinction? Now implicit in Hormozi's entire brand.
The automated webinar? Now Brunson's bread and butter.
The VSL? Now industry standard.
The lead magnet concept? Now so ubiquitous nobody remembers who invented it.

This is what Girard would call the "scandal of the model" -- when the imitators surpass the originator in visibility, the market begins to see the imitators as the originators. The model's own creation is turned against him.

The fix is not to compete on visibility volume (Rich will never out-post Hormozi). The fix is to compete on DEPTH and UNIQUENESS of the desire mediated -- to own a desire that nobody else CAN mediate because nobody else has the credibility, the track record, or the intellectual framework to back it up.

That desire is: **"The ability to THINK about business and AI at a level that makes everything else simple -- the same level of thinking that produced the strategies the gurus teach."**

Nobody else can claim that. Nobody else taught the gurus. Nobody else has 20 years of documented strategic thinking that predates the current market. Nobody else combines AI systems thinking (Force Multiplier) with cognitive self-mastery (ZenithMind) with strategic pattern recognition (Connect the Dots).

The raw material is the best in the market. The marketing of that raw material is the weakest. That is the gap. That is the opportunity.
