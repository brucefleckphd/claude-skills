# Anti-Mimetic Differentiator: Live Competitive Analysis
## AI for Business Owners/Entrepreneurs Market — February 2026

*Analysis of 15 competitors through the lens of Girard's mimetic theory: where has the market unconsciously converged into sameness, and where does Rich Schefren have genuine differentiation?*

---

## Section 1: The Convergence Map

### 1.1 Promise Convergence — What Everyone Is Promising

The market has collapsed into four dominant promise clusters. Nearly every competitor makes some variation of these:

**Cluster A: "Save Time / Do More With Less"**
- **Jasper AI**: "No technical setup, no prompt engineering, just faster marketing that works"
- **Copy.ai**: "Eliminate GTM bloat" and "codify best practices"
- **Russell Brunson / ClickFunnels**: "Build funnels in less than an hour that previously took a day"
- **Frank Kern**: "Acquire leads and customers effortlessly"
- **Amy Porterfield**: AI assistant helps with "drafting compelling sales page copy, brainstorming webinar talking points, simplifying tech issues"
- **Dan Martell**: Entire brand built on "Buy Back Your Time" — AI is positioned as the ultimate time-buyback tool
- **Rich Schefren**: "6-person team operating with the capability of 6,000" (Force Multiplier webinar)

This is the most crowded promise in the market. Nearly every player is saying some version of "AI will give you more output with less input." The specific metrics vary — "10x your output," "save 10 hours a week," "build in minutes not days" — but the underlying promise is identical.

**Cluster B: "Build a Business / Make Money With AI"**
- **Liam Ottley**: "Build a wildly profitable AI business" via AI automation agency model
- **Sam Woods**: "Build, deploy, and scale intelligent AI agents" — Agent Operating System as a business model
- **Iman Gadzhi**: Personal branding as "essential tool in the age of AI" — AI as path to agency income
- **Perry Marshall**: "80/20 A.I. Hyperdrive" — AI to eliminate $10/hour tasks, focus on high-value work
- **Alex Hormozi**: "Simple profitable business idea: AI implementation consulting. Just go to normal businesses and help them implement AI tools."

This cluster treats AI as a revenue opportunity — either start an AI agency, or use AI to scale an existing business to new revenue levels.

**Cluster C: "Future-Proof Yourself / Don't Get Left Behind"**
- **Jasper AI**: "Turn AI into a durable competitive advantage"
- **DigitalMarketer / Ryan Deiss**: Literally shut down the course business because "why should someone pay for a course when AI can provide what they need instantly" — implying: adapt or become obsolete
- **Iman Gadzhi**: Personal branding positioned as survival strategy "in the age of AI"
- **Matt Wolfe**: Entire content model is "here's the latest AI tool you need to know about" — implicit FOMO engine
- **Frank Kern**: "Intent Based Branding 4.0" — the "4.0" versioning itself signals "you need the latest"

The fear-of-being-left-behind narrative is the dominant emotional driver across the market. Nearly every competitor leverages some version of FOMO, even when they don't say it explicitly.

**Cluster D: "AI is Easy / Anyone Can Do It"**
- **Jasper AI**: "No technical setup, no prompt engineering"
- **Copy.ai**: "Harness the power of AI without being AI experts"
- **Russell Brunson**: "Create a funnel in just 10-15 minutes, even without web design or development skills"
- **Liam Ottley**: Free 60-hour course as proof that "anyone can learn this"
- **Amy Porterfield**: "Custom-trained AI assistant" built into every module — AI as invisible helper
- **Frank Kern**: "Land clients quickly without ads, cold calls, or complicated tech"

The "democratization" promise — AI makes complex things simple — is universal. Nobody is positioning AI as something that requires deep skill or thinking to use well.

### 1.2 Narrative Convergence — The Story Everyone Tells

There is one dominant narrative arc across the market, with minor variations:

**The Universal Narrative: "The Great Disruption"**
1. AI is changing everything (the inciting event)
2. Most people are using it wrong or not at all (the gap)
3. I figured out the right way (the discovery)
4. Follow my system/framework (the solution)
5. Get results fast while others fall behind (the transformation + urgency)

Specific examples of this arc:

- **Ryan Deiss** literally embodies it: "I'm retiring from the course business because AI changed everything. Here's the new model." His entire DigitalMarketer pivot IS the narrative.
- **Liam Ottley** tells a young-guy-discovers-opportunity story: dropped out, found AI agencies, built a business, now teaches others the "roadmap."
- **Frank Kern** layers nostalgia onto it: "The timeless secrets of history's greatest marketers" combined with "brand new A.I." — old wisdom + new tech.
- **Dan Martell**: "How to Make $1M in the NEW Era of AI" — the "NEW Era" framing is the narrative itself.
- **Jasper AI**: "The End of the AI Experiment: The Operational Era is Here" — we've moved past exploration, now it's execution time.

**The Counter-Narrative (Minority Position)**
Only two competitors consistently push back against the panic:

- **Alex Hormozi**: "In an age of AI, the most valuable business insights won't come from predicting what will change, but what will stay the same." He positions AI as a tool within business fundamentals, not as the revolution itself.
- **Codie Sanchez**: Barely mentions AI at all. Her entire positioning is "buy boring businesses that generate cash flow." AI is a feature of her community platform, not her message.

### 1.3 Offer Structure Convergence — How Everyone Packages

The market has converged on three dominant packaging models:

**Model A: Free Content Funnel to High-Ticket Program**
- **Liam Ottley**: Free 60-hour course on Skool to $1,500 Accelerator
- **Frank Kern**: Free GoHighLevel workshop to paid courses ($2,997+)
- **Russell Brunson**: Free challenges/books to ClickFunnels subscription + high-ticket events
- **Amy Porterfield**: Free bootcamp/waitlist to Digital Course Academy
- **Rich Schefren**: AI Imprint Challenge ($97 VIP) to Force Multiplier ($5K-$13K)

**Model B: Subscription Community**
- **Wes Roth**: "NATURAL 20" Skool community at $37/month
- **Liam Ottley**: AI Automation Agency Hub on Skool (free + paid tiers)
- **Iman Gadzhi**: Digital Launchpad subscription portal
- **Codie Sanchez**: Contrarian Community (annual membership with events)
- **Rich Schefren**: ZenithPro VIP/Elite ($520-$624/year)

**Model C: Course + Community + Calls**
- **Liam Ottley**: AAA Accelerator = course content + weekly calls with Liam + 1-on-1 calls with coaches
- **Dan Martell**: SaaS Academy = coaching + community + playbooks
- **Perry Marshall**: RenAI Lab = 2 live AI labs/month + community + challenges
- **Amy Porterfield**: DCA = course + AI assistant + community
- **Rich Schefren**: Force Multiplier = 10 days building real systems + team access

The "course + community + weekly calls" trifecta is the standard template. Nearly everyone offers it. The main variable is price point and whether the calls are group or 1-on-1.

### 1.4 Proof Convergence — What Results Everyone Showcases

Three dominant proof types:

**Revenue/Income Screenshots**
- **Liam Ottley**: "1,500 entrepreneurs who have built their own AI Automation Agency"
- **Rich Schefren**: "$2.24M in revenue, 500% AOV increase, 37K new contacts acquired FREE" and "$1.3M in 7 days from a single AI-written sales letter"
- **Dan Martell**: "Increased MRR by 209% within six months"
- **Alex Hormozi**: Entire brand built on "$100M" credibility

**Time Saved / Efficiency Gains**
- **Jasper AI**: "Scaling high-quality content" as fastest-growing priority, 2.4x increase over 2025
- **ClickFunnels**: "Build funnels in less than an hour that previously took a day"
- **Copy.ai**: "Shortening content creation time"

**"I Did It, You Can Too" Personal Transformation**
- **Liam Ottley**: Young entrepreneur who built it from nothing
- **Iman Gadzhi**: "Dropout at 17, millionaire at 21"
- **Dan Martell**: Overcame personal struggles, now coaches 800+ founders
- **Rich Schefren**: "29 years documenting his own struggles with procrastination" (ZenithMind OS)

### 1.5 Language Convergence — Specific Words and Phrases the Market Has Adopted

These words/phrases appear across 5+ competitors:

| Converged Language | Used By |
|---|---|
| "AI-powered" | Jasper, Copy.ai, ClickFunnels, DigitalMarketer, Amy Porterfield, Rich Schefren |
| "Scale" / "scaling" | Liam Ottley, Dan Martell, Alex Hormozi, Iman Gadzhi, Sam Woods, Rich Schefren |
| "Automate" / "automation" | Liam Ottley, Sam Woods, Jasper, Copy.ai, ClickFunnels, Dan Martell |
| "Operating system" | Sam Woods ("Agent Operating System"), Rich Schefren ("ZenithMind OS"), Hormozi fans ("AI Operating System") |
| "Playbook" / "blueprint" | Dan Martell, Frank Kern, Alex Hormozi, Liam Ottley |
| "Future-proof" | Copy.ai ("Future proof your business"), Jasper, DigitalMarketer |
| "Framework" / "system" | Perry Marshall, Rich Schefren, Liam Ottley, Dan Martell |
| "Agent" / "AI agents" | Jasper, Sam Woods, Rich Schefren, Liam Ottley |
| "Force multiplier" / "multiplier" | Rich Schefren (product name), Alex Hormozi ("AI is a multiplier") |
| "Buy back your time" | Dan Martell (book title), implicit in everyone's time-saving promises |
| "10x" | Used ubiquitously as shorthand for AI's impact |

### 1.6 Enemy Convergence — What Everyone Positions Against

**Enemy 1: "The Old Way of Doing Things"** (Universal)
Every single competitor positions against manual, pre-AI methods. Whether it's "old marketing," "old funnel building," "old copywriting," or "old business processes," the enemy is always the pre-AI status quo.

**Enemy 2: "Being Left Behind"** (Most Competitors)
The implicit or explicit threat that inaction leads to irrelevance. Jasper, DigitalMarketer, Iman Gadzhi, Matt Wolfe, and Frank Kern all leverage this.

**Enemy 3: "Using AI Wrong"** (Emerging)
A newer enemy positioning: not that you're NOT using AI, but that you're using it badly.
- **Rich Schefren**: "Not another 'how to use ChatGPT' workshop"
- **Jasper**: "The End of the AI Experiment" — you experimented, now operationalize
- **Perry Marshall**: A "sophisticated GPT is the free download of 2026" — implying most AI use is commodity-level

**Enemy 4: "Complexity / Tech Overwhelm"** (Tool-focused competitors)
- **ClickFunnels**: Enemy is complicated tech
- **Copy.ai**: Enemy is "GTM bloat" and "dozens of separate solutions"
- **Amy Porterfield**: Enemy is being "stuck" on tech issues

## Section 2: Where Rich Has Already Converged (Honest Assessment)

This section examines Rich's actual marketing language and positioning against the convergence patterns identified above. This is meant to be constructively honest.

### 2.1 Rich Uses the "Leverage / Do More With Less" Promise

The "Insane Leverage Window" webinar title and the "6-person team operating with the capability of 6,000" claim are powerful — but they sit squarely in Promise Cluster A (save time / do more with less). This is the single most crowded promise in the market. Dan Martell's entire brand is "buy back your time." Jasper promises "faster marketing." ClickFunnels promises "funnels in minutes." Rich's version is more dramatic in scale ("6,000x") but the category is identical.

### 2.2 Rich Uses the Standard Narrative Arc

The Force Multiplier webinar follows the universal narrative: AI is changing everything, most people are using it wrong, I figured out the right way (CLI + agents, not just chat), follow my system, get results fast. The "less than 1% of AI users have figured out" framing is a classic scarcity/discovery narrative that Liam Ottley, Frank Kern, and others also use (Ottley's "roadmap," Kern's "lost secrets").

### 2.3 Rich Uses Revenue Proof Like Everyone Else

"$2.24M in revenue," "$1.3M in 7 days from a single AI-written sales letter," "500% AOV increase" — these are impressive numbers, but they are the same TYPE of proof the market converges on. Liam Ottley shows agency revenue. Dan Martell shows MRR increases. Alex Hormozi shows $100M exits. The proof category is identical; only the specific numbers differ.

### 2.4 Rich Has Adopted Converged Language

Terms like "AI-powered," "operating system" (ZenithMind OS), "framework," "system," "scale," and "force multiplier" (which Hormozi also uses as a phrase) all appear in Rich's marketing. The "OS" metaphor in particular is now used by Sam Woods (Agent Operating System), by Hormozi fans, and by Rich — it's becoming generic.

### 2.5 Rich Positions Against the Same Enemies

"Not another 'how to use ChatGPT' workshop" is a smart positioning move, but it's the same Enemy 3 (Using AI Wrong) that Perry Marshall, Jasper, and increasingly the whole market uses. Everyone is now distancing from "basic prompt engineering" — it's the new baseline, not a differentiator.

### 2.6 The Offer Structure Is Standard

AI Imprint Challenge ($97) to Force Multiplier ($5K-$13K) is a classic Model A free/low-ticket front-end to high-ticket program. This is identical to Liam Ottley's free course to $1,500 Accelerator, Frank Kern's free workshop to paid program, and Amy Porterfield's free bootcamp to course purchase. The price points differ; the architecture is the same.

---

## Section 3: Genuine Differentiation — What's Actually Different

Despite the convergence, there ARE real differences. Here's what actually separates Rich from the field — and what separates a few competitors from each other.

### 3.1 Rich's Genuine Differentiators

**Differentiator 1: Strategic Depth Over Tactical Tutorials**
Rich teaches THINKING with AI, not just DOING with AI. His Connect the Dots program distinguishes between "Mode 1" (chat interface — what 99% use) and "Mode 2" (coding CLI — tools that read files, edit documents, create systems that persist). This is a genuinely different frame. No other competitor in this analysis makes this specific technical/philosophical distinction. Liam Ottley teaches building AI solutions for clients. Frank Kern teaches using AI for marketing. Rich teaches using AI as a thinking partner and operational system.

**Differentiator 2: 20+ Years of Strategy Credibility**
Rich is the "guru's guru" — the strategist behind Kern, Brunson, Walker, and Deiss. He taught the people who are now his competitors. This is not a mimetic position; it's a historical fact. No amount of copying can replicate origination. Perry Marshall has similar depth (80/20 + decades of experience), but Perry doesn't position against the same competitor set.

**Differentiator 3: ZenithMind OS — The Psychology/Cognitive Layer**
ZenithMind OS addresses the "knowing-doing gap" — the psychological blocks that prevent execution. This is genuinely different from anything else in the market. Nobody else is combining AI with cognitive engineering. It's not an AI tool or an AI business course; it's an AI-powered system for rewiring how entrepreneurs think and act. The closest analog might be Tony Robbins, not Liam Ottley.

**Differentiator 4: Connect the Dots — Small-Group Strategic Immersion**
A capped 10-person cohort at $10K where you sit with Rich and build your AI operating infrastructure together is structurally different from "course + community + calls." It's closer to a private consulting engagement than a program. The intimacy and price point ($10K for a 3-day in-person experience) has no direct analog among the competitors analyzed.

### 3.2 Other Competitors' Genuine Differentiators

- **Alex Hormozi**: Unique because he DOESN'T sell AI education. He sells business fundamentals and occasionally comments on AI. His "what will stay the same" positioning is genuinely contrarian in a market obsessed with change.
- **Codie Sanchez**: Unique because AI is barely in her messaging at all. Her positioning is "buy boring businesses." AI is infrastructure, not identity.
- **Ryan Deiss / DigitalMarketer**: Unique because he publicly KILLED his course business, calling the entire model obsolete. His pivot to "Actual Intelligence + Artificial Intelligence" implementation services is a genuine structural break.
- **Chris Do**: Unique because his angle is creative identity — "unbland yourself" — in a market full of optimization and efficiency talk.

## Section 4: Open Space — Unoccupied Positions

Based on the convergence map, here are positioning territories that NO competitor currently occupies:

### 4.1 "AI for Judgment, Not Just Execution"

Every competitor positions AI as a DOING tool — it writes, it builds, it automates, it creates. Nobody is positioning AI as a JUDGMENT tool — something that helps you make better decisions, see patterns you'd miss, stress-test your thinking, challenge your assumptions. Rich's "Connect the Dots" philosophy touches this, but his marketing still leads with execution benefits ("build an AI agent in 35 minutes"). The open position: "AI doesn't just do things for you. It makes you think better."

### 4.2 "The AI Strategist, Not the AI Tactician"

The entire market is tactical: here are the tools, here are the prompts, here are the workflows, here's how to build an agent. Nobody is occupying the position of "I teach you STRATEGY in the age of AI — when to use AI, when not to, what to build vs. what to buy, how AI changes competitive dynamics, how to think about AI as a strategic asset." Rich is closest to this, but his marketing often slips into tactical proof (revenue numbers, agent-building demos) rather than staying in the strategic frame.

### 4.3 "The Anti-FOMO Position"

Everyone sells urgency and fear of being left behind. NOBODY is saying: "Slow down. Think first. Most of what you're being sold about AI is hype. Here's what actually matters." Alex Hormozi gestures toward this with his "what will stay the same" quote, but he doesn't sell an AI program. The position of "the calm, strategic voice in a market full of panic" is wide open. Rich's credibility and track record make him the natural occupant of this position.

### 4.4 "AI as Competitive Moat, Not Productivity Hack"

Everyone sells AI as a productivity tool. Nobody is teaching business owners how to use AI to build genuine competitive advantages that compound over time — proprietary data flywheels, AI-trained-on-your-business models, strategic positioning that AI can't replicate for competitors. Alex Hormozi has mentioned this concept ("the real competitive advantage is not the model but the data"), but he doesn't teach it. Perry Marshall hints at it ("build competitive moats"). The position of "I teach you how to use AI to build something your competitors CAN'T copy" is unoccupied.

### 4.5 "The Post-Prompt World"

Nearly every competitor still operates in the "prompt engineering" paradigm — how to talk to AI better. Rich's distinction between Mode 1 (chat) and Mode 2 (CLI/agents) is a genuinely forward position, but it's not being marketed as a paradigm shift. The framing "prompt engineering is already obsolete — here's what replaced it" would be a sharp, differentiated position that nobody else is clearly staking.

### 4.6 "Integration Intelligence — AI Across the Whole Business"

Most competitors teach AI for ONE function: marketing (Kern, Deiss, Porterfield), content (Wolfe, Jasper), agency services (Ottley, Gadzhi), or productivity (Martell). Nobody teaches AI as a cross-functional strategic capability — how to use AI across strategy, operations, marketing, product development, hiring, financial modeling, and competitive analysis simultaneously. Rich's "Force Multiplier" concept implies this, but the marketing tends to lead with marketing/copywriting examples.

### 4.7 "AI for the Established, Not the Aspiring"

The overwhelming majority of AI business education targets people who want to START something — start an agency, start making money, start a course. Almost nobody specifically serves the established business owner ($1M-$10M+) who already has a working business and needs to integrate AI strategically without disrupting what works. This is Rich's natural audience but the positioning isn't explicit enough.

---

## Summary: The Strategic Recommendation

The market has converged on:
- **Promise**: Save time, make money, don't get left behind
- **Narrative**: AI changed everything, I found the secret, follow my system
- **Packaging**: Free content to high-ticket program, course + community + calls
- **Proof**: Revenue screenshots, time saved, personal transformation story
- **Language**: AI-powered, scale, automate, operating system, framework, 10x
- **Enemy**: The old way, being left behind, using AI wrong

Rich's genuine, hard-to-copy advantages are:
1. Strategic depth and original thinking (not tutorials)
2. "Guru's guru" credibility — he taught the teachers
3. The psychology/cognition layer (ZenithMind OS)
4. Small-group strategic immersion (Connect the Dots format)
5. The Mode 1 vs. Mode 2 technical distinction

The biggest open territories are:
1. AI for judgment and thinking, not just execution
2. The anti-FOMO, "slow down and think" position
3. AI as competitive moat, not productivity hack
4. The post-prompt paradigm
5. AI for established businesses, not aspiring entrepreneurs

The central insight from this analysis: **Rich's actual approach to AI IS different from the market. But his marketing language has been pulled into mimetic convergence with the market.** The challenge is not to change what he teaches — it's to change how he talks about what he teaches. The substance is differentiated; the messaging has converged.
