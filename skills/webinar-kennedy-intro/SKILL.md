# Kennedy Introduction Frameworks

Dan Kennedy's systematic approach to the Open - the first 10 minutes that determine whether they stay or leave. Based on decades of direct response and group selling experience.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating the first 10-15 minutes of any group presentation
- When attendees can easily leave (webinar, optional seminar)
- When speaking to audiences who may not know you
- Improving show-up-to-stay ratio
- Preventing early checkout behavior

## Core Philosophy

> "The first job of the open is to stop the listener, viewer, audience member from checking out because their earliest impulse is often to check out."

**Kennedy's Truth**: In one-to-one selling, people can't easily walk away. In group selling (any media), they can check out instantly. Your first job is prevention, not conversion.

## Frameworks Included (24)

### 3.1 Open Objectives (4)
- Stop Checkout Immediately
- Engage and Make Them Think
- Frame the Presentation
- Short-Circuit Instant Negatives

### 3.2 Who/Why Establishment (8)
- Celebrity Positioning
- Authority Establishment
- Credibility Building
- Affinity with Audience
- Likability (if you sell with it)
- Role/Voice/Personality Consistency
- Why You're Talking to Them About This
- Why You're Talking to Them About This NOW

### 3.3 Stay-Tuned Tactics (12)
- Quick Promises (3-5 maximum)
- Personal Relevance Statement
- Proactive Questions
- Pure Curiosity
- Breaking News (if live)
- Warning of Threat/Danger
- Specter of Loss
- Benefit Summary Statement
- Bribe to Stay Tuned

## 3.1 OPEN OBJECTIVES

### 1. Stop Checkout Immediately

**Category**: 3.1 - Core Objectives
**Principle**: Your first job is preventing exit, not creating interest.

**The Problem**:
In one-to-one selling, if you're at someone's kitchen table with the pot-and-pan samples unpacked, they can't easily stop the presentation without being incredibly rude. In group selling, they can check out instantly:
- Stand up and leave (physical room)
- Mentally tune out (physical room)
- Click away (webinar)
- Go elsewhere online (webinar)

**Kennedy's Observation**:
> "I have people bring me, like, scripts all the time, and the good stuff starts, like, eight minutes in. And they will say, yeah, but when they get here, I said, they are not going to get there. They have too many options to check out."

**When to Use**:
- First 60-90 seconds of any presentation
- When you know audience is "cold"
- When you have high early drop-off rates

**How It Works**:
1. Assume their earliest impulse is to check out
2. Front-load engagement elements in first 90 seconds
3. Don't build up slowly - hit them immediately
4. Make them think/question/react right away

**Why It Matters**:
If they check out in the first few minutes, nothing else you do matters. All your great work happens after they've already left.

---

### 2. Engage and Make Them Think

**Category**: 3.1 - Core Objectives
**Principle**: Mental engagement stops physical/digital exit.

**The Method**:
Get them asking questions in their own head within the first 2 minutes. Not rhetorical questions - real questions they want answered.

**Examples**:
- "Have you ever noticed some people never get sick?"
- "What if I told you the #1 thing doctors recommend for X actually makes it worse?"
- "Do you know the real reason they came to get your guns?"

**When to Use**:
- Immediately after stopping checkout
- To transition from hook to authority
- When you sense mental wandering

**Why It Matters**:
People who are thinking are engaged. People who are engaged don't leave.

---

### 3. Frame the Presentation

**Category**: 3.1 - Core Objectives
**Principle**: Tell them what to expect so they know what they're getting.

**What to Frame**:
- How long this will take
- What you're going to cover (and not cover)
- What they'll be able to do by the end
- What kind of presentation this is

**Kennedy's Warning**:
Don't assume they know what this is. Even if they registered for "real estate webinar," they don't know if this is:
- Teaching them to invest
- Selling them a course
- Recruiting them to sell real estate
- Pitching them to buy property

**When to Use**:
- Within first 3-5 minutes
- After initial hook
- Before establishing who you are

**How to Do It**:
"In the next 47 minutes [lie about time], we're going to cover three things: [1] how to X, [2] why Y doesn't work, and [3] the one thing you must do before Z."

---

### 4. Short-Circuit Instant Negatives

**Category**: 3.1 - Core Objectives
**Principle**: Kill instant objections before they form.

**What Are Instant Negatives**:
Visceral negative reactions that cause immediate tune-out:
- "This is MLM" (if it's not)
- "This is options trading" (if it's not)
- "This guy's going to pitch me" (before you establish value)
- "This won't work for me" (before they know what it is)

**Kennedy's Example**:
In his real estate VSL to financial newsletter subscribers:
> "This is not anything risky like options or stock trading..." (said in paragraph 3)

He knows where they're coming from (financial lists), so he rules out what they see most and many have negative reactions to.

**When to Use**:
- Within first 5 minutes
- As soon as you reveal what category you're in
- Before they mentally file you in wrong category

**How It Works**:
1. Know your audience's past experiences
2. Know what they've been burned by
3. Explicitly state: "This is NOT [that thing]"
4. Give them a new category to put you in

---

## 3.2 WHO/WHY ESTABLISHMENT

**Kennedy's Critical Truth**:
> "Think of the presentation, no matter how good a job you do in advance of it, think of it as happening in a vacuum, as if they saw nothing before they got there, they heard nothing before they got there, they have fallen out of the sky into the room or in front of the screen, and now what do they need to know for this presentation to be effective?"

### 5. Celebrity Positioning

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: If you are famous, remind them you are famous.

**The Challenge**:
Celebrity means different things in different contexts:
- **Global Celebrity**: Fran Tarkenton (in 1987)
- **Local Celebrity**: Most successful attorney in your market
- **Manufactured Celebrity**: "King of High Ticket Sales"

**Kennedy's Backstage Approach**:
> "Almost without exception, I did not hang out as people were coming in the door and greet them and talk to them and make nice to them, because that's not what a celebrity does. A celebrity is backstage and appears on stage when it's time for them to perform. Furthermore, they usually have an opening act."

**When to Use**:
- If you have any claim to fame
- If you've been featured anywhere
- If you have credentials worth mentioning
- If you've achieved results worth noting

**How It Works**:
1. Don't assume they know who you are (even if they do)
2. Show, don't just tell (video clips, media mentions)
3. Make celebrity relevant to THIS topic
4. Use 2-3 minutes maximum in infomercial time

**Examples**:
- Film clip of media appearances
- "As seen on..." montage
- Award/recognition mention
- "The only X who Y"

---

### 6. Authority Establishment

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: You must be an expert IN THIS SUBJECT to them.

**What Must Be Established**:
Not just that you're smart or successful, but that you are THE authority on THIS topic for THIS audience.

**Kennedy's Example**:
> "If Ben Glass is an attorney, he markets only to attorneys, and he's driving only attorneys to his webcast, still it's good to remind them that he's an attorney, not a non-attorney, and that he's an extremely successful attorney."

**When to Use**:
- Within first 5-7 minutes
- Before making any major claims
- Even with warm audiences

**Authority Elements to Include**:
1. Years of experience in THIS field
2. Number of transactions/clients/results
3. Specific credentials relevant to topic
4. Unique positioning statement

**Why You Can't Skip This**:
> "The better known you are to your audience, the less of this you must establish, but you still ought not assume any of it as preexisting. You can short it, but you ought not eliminate any of it."

---

### 7. Credibility Building

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: Proof you've actually done what you're talking about.

**Difference from Authority**:
- Authority = who you are
- Credibility = what you've done

**What to Include**:
- Specific results (numbers, not generalities)
- Recent results (not just from 10 years ago)
- Relatable results (they can see themselves achieving)
- Verifiable results (names, places, dates)

**Kennedy's Warning**:
Don't make it too perfect. If you only had wins and no losses, it's not believable.

**When to Use**:
- After authority establishment
- Before making bold promises
- When introducing a new claim

---

### 8. Affinity with Audience

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: Show you're one of them or understand them deeply.

**How to Establish Affinity**:
1. **Shared Background**: "I'm an attorney speaking to attorneys"
2. **Shared Struggle**: "I was where you are 5 years ago"
3. **Shared Values**: "I believe in X just like you do"
4. **Shared Enemy**: "I'm as frustrated with Y as you are"

**Kennedy's Observation**:
Even if you're extremely successful now and they're struggling, you need to show you came from where they are. The "then and now" positioning.

**When to Use**:
- When speaking to specific profession/demographic
- When you actually share background
- To overcome "this won't work for me" objection

---

### 9. Likability (if you sell with it)

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: Not everybody sells by being likable, but most people are more effective if people like them.

**Kennedy's Nixon Example**:
> "Nixon's checker speech, he carried the dog. I mean, there's a reason for that."

**Likability Tactics**:
- Humor (self-deprecating often works best)
- Vulnerability (admitting past mistakes)
- Relatability (showing you're human)
- Generosity (giving value upfront)

**When NOT to Use**:
Some people sell through intimidation, fear, urgency, or authority without likability. Know your brand.

**When to Use**:
- If your natural personality is warm/friendly
- If selling to consumers vs. hard-core investors
- If you need them to like you to trust you

---

### 10. Role/Voice/Personality Consistency

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: Establish who this person is talking to them and maintain it throughout.

**What This Means**:
Are you:
- The mentor/teacher?
- The fellow traveler sharing discoveries?
- The investigative reporter exposing truth?
- The authority laying down law?
- The rebel challenging status quo?

**Kennedy's Point**:
Pick one and stick with it. Don't start as friendly teacher and shift to hard-sell closer. The shift breaks trust.

**When to Use**:
- First 5 minutes - establish the voice
- Maintain throughout presentation
- Never break character

---

### 11. Why You're Talking to Them About This

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: There must be a reason YOU are talking about THIS topic (not just money).

**What Makes This Legitimate**:
- Your background connects to topic
- Your results in this area
- Your mission related to topic
- Your discovery that changed everything

**Kennedy's Truth About Fair**:
Later in middle, you'll establish "why you're selling" (mission beyond money). But here you establish why you're qualified to even be having this conversation.

**Examples**:
- "I've been in real estate for 30 years"
- "I'm a doctor who discovered this"
- "I lost my sister to this condition"
- "I've done 1,200 transactions"

**When to Use**:
- Within first 10 minutes
- Before making major claims
- To build credibility and authority together

---

### 12. Why You're Talking to Them About This NOW

**Category**: 3.2 - Who/Why Establishment
**Principle**: There must be a timely relevance reason for this presentation happening today.

**Kennedy's Categories of "Why Now"**:

1. **Current/Impending Event**:
   - "Housing sales improved 6.2% last month - best in 4 years"
   - "New law goes into effect July 1st"

2. **New Discovery/Breakthrough**:
   - "Just discovered in France by doctor"
   - "New technology that changes everything"

3. **Life Benchmark**:
   - "If you're approaching retirement..."
   - "If you just had a baby..."

4. **Crisis/Threat**:
   - "Coming coding crisis caused by Obamacare"
   - "They're coming to get your guns"

**Kennedy's Observation on Evergreen**:
> "This argues against evergreen presentations. However, if the person is new to it and there's an evergreen timing reason, then the presentation can be evergreen."

**The Timing Truth**:
> "Most of the people we sell to are very short-term thinkers. They have a pretty small frame of reference. They are into what is affecting them today, this week, this month. They look at the world through a pretty small window. And if you're standing too far to the side of the window, they don't see you at all. So timing relevance is useful."

**When to Use**:
- Within first 10 minutes
- When there IS a timely hook
- To update evergreen presentations

**How to Create It** (if not obvious):
- Tie to recent news in their industry
- Tie to season/time of year
- Tie to their business cycle
- Create artificial deadline

---

## 3.3 STAY-TUNED TACTICS

### 13. Quick Promises (3-5 maximum)

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Give them specific reasons to keep listening in the first few minutes.

**Kennedy's Formula**:
> "I never like to script more than five because I think people forgot the first one by the time you get to the fifth one. So three quick promises that will stop somebody in their tracks. That will all, that's interesting. That's exciting. I do want to hear that."

**The Copywriting Equivalent**:
This is the pre-head, headline, and subhead of your presentation. Top third of first page.

**What Makes a Good Quick Promise**:
1. Specific (not vague benefit)
2. Exciting (makes them lean in)
3. Believable (not so big they tune out)
4. Deliverable (you can actually cover it)

**Examples**:
- "3 ways to double your income in 90 days"
- "The one thing that makes all diets fail"
- "How to get your first deal in 72 hours"

**When to Use**:
- First 2-3 minutes
- After very brief who-you-are
- Before going deep on anything

**Critical Truth**:
> "They literally are making the decision to, okay, I'll give him a little more time now because of these promises."

---

### 14. Personal Relevance Statement ("If you are...")

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Narrow "if you are" statement makes them feel this is for them.

**The Formula**:
"If you are [specific demographic with specific pain points], you especially need to stay tuned because [specific benefit]."

**Kennedy's Example**:
> "If you are an attorney who's been in practice for no less than 20 years and you have attorneys working for you that frustrate the hell out of you and you have a family who wants you at home more than you are, you especially need to stay tuned."

**Critical Constraint**:
> "So there's a link here to what audience you collect to whether or not you can use this tactic. If he's driven any and every attorney from the world to the same webcast, he doesn't dare say it because he immediately gets the majority of the viewers to tune out."

**When to Use**:
- Only when you have tight, driven audience
- Within first 5 minutes
- To create "this is for ME" reaction

**When NOT to Use**:
When you have broad, diverse audience. The narrower the audience, the more powerful this tactic.

---

### 15. Proactive Questions

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Frame your promises as questions to create curiosity gap.

**How It Works**:
Instead of stating promises, ask questions that imply the promises.

**Examples**:
- "If on the top ten list of things that bother you in life, [problem] is one of them, you need to stay tuned."
- "If a magic genie appeared and offered you three wishes and the wishes were [outcome 1, 2, 3], you need to stay tuned."
- "What if I told you [surprising claim]?"

**When to Use**:
- As alternative to direct promises
- When claims might seem too bold
- To engage critical thinkers

---

### 16. Pure Curiosity

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Mystery about what it IS creates curiosity to find out.

**Kennedy's Take**:
> "I don't like it much, but you do see it used where they have been driven to a presentation, not knowing what the thing is that they're going to discover. And the open still keeps it a mystery, but the curiosity about it is about what it isn't and about the benefits that it delivers."

**Example Structure**:
"If there was a magic pill that you could get and you could take that instantly eliminated body odor, bad breath, made you a charismatic individual, multiplied your sex appeal, and caused money to fall out of trees and hit you on the head, would you like the pill?"

**When to Use**:
- When you can't or don't want to reveal product yet
- When benefits are more compelling than mechanism
- In certain launch sequences

**Caution**:
Kennedy doesn't love this approach, but acknowledges it works in some contexts.

---

### 17. Breaking News (if live)

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: If presenting live, use news events happening NOW.

**Kennedy's Warning**:
> "It has to be breaking news that your audience knows about. And increasingly, fewer and fewer people know about fewer and fewer things in the news."

**The Leno Example**:
> "If you watched Leno at all in the late years of Leno, and you paid attention, you saw year to year to year, more and more, explaining of who or what he was talking about to make sure that you got the joke. Everybody kind of knew that stuff. And so Carson didn't have to explain much."

**The Reality**:
> "Who won American Idol last night? Generally, a whole lot more people know that and are talking about that the next morning than know that we just invaded Iraq for the fifth time."

**When to Use**:
- Only if you're certain your audience knows about it
- Only if it's relevant to your topic
- Only if you can tie it directly to your message

**How to Test**:
If you have to explain the news event, it's not breaking news to them.

---

### 18. Warning of Threat/Danger

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Fear of loss is more powerful than hope of gain.

**Kennedy's Hospital Example**:
ICD-10 coding crisis for hospitals - codes going from 40,000 to 246,000. This is a massive crisis, but when his team called hospital administrators:

> "Out of 22 completed conversations, four could quote some number of the size of the coming crisis. So I've got a crisis to work with. It's a great crowbar, but I can't assume that there's any knowledge about the crisis."

**The Approach**:
1. Assume they DON'T know about the threat
2. Reveal the threat
3. Make it immediate and personal
4. Position your solution as the answer

**When to Use**:
- When there IS a legitimate threat
- When you have a real solution
- Within first 5-10 minutes

**Examples**:
- "Coming law change that will X"
- "The thing your doctor isn't telling you"
- "What happens when they come for your guns"

---

### 19. Specter of Loss

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Paint picture of what they'll lose if they don't pay attention.

**Kennedy's Example**:
> "Stay tuned because they're coming to get your guns. And I got new proof that they're coming to get your guns tomorrow. If you put that in front of a bunch of gun owners, you gained another three or four minutes to hold their attention. They're not clicking out."

**Difference from Threat/Danger**:
- Threat = external event happening
- Specter of Loss = personal consequence of inaction

**When to Use**:
- When you can paint vivid loss scenario
- When audience has something to lose
- Early in presentation (first 10 minutes)

---

### 20. Benefit Summary Statement

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Sum up the ultimate benefit in one powerful statement.

**Kennedy's Example**:
From his 1999 Peter Lowe presentation:

> "If you are a salesman, I'm going to show you how to never have to cold prospect again. Okay, so that's a summary benefit of everything we do with magnetic marketing and salespeople is the ultimate benefit is they don't have to do any prospecting. Prospects come to them."

**How to Create One**:
1. What's the #1 problem they have?
2. What's the #1 outcome they want?
3. State it as directly as possible
4. Make it THE measuring stick for the presentation

**When to Use**:
- Within first 5 minutes
- After quick promises
- As the overarching theme

---

### 21. Bribe to Stay Tuned

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Offer something free just for staying through the presentation.

**Examples**:
- "Everybody on this call gets a free ebook"
- "We're going to give you a free 17-point checklist"
- "Everybody who stays gets the code for free download"
- "We're drawing for a car - you got a code number when you registered"

**Kennedy's Truth**:
This is a literal bribe. You're paying them (with value) to give you their attention.

**When to Use**:
- Teleseminars/webcasts work best for this
- When you have a deliverable you can actually give
- When audience is cold or skeptical

**Caution**:
Make sure the bribe is valuable enough to matter but doesn't overshadow your actual offer.

---

### 22. Direct Specific Instruction

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Tell them explicitly what to do and why.

**Kennedy's Example**:
> "I rarely do a stay tuned statement without saying stay tuned one way or another. You want to make sure you have a pad. You want to make sure you have a pan because you're going to want to take notes. You want to stay tuned."

**The Formula**:
1. Direct instruction ("Get a pen")
2. Reason why ("You're going to want to take notes")
3. Explicit statement ("Stay tuned")

**When to Use**:
- First 3-5 minutes
- After promises
- Before going into meat of content

**Why It Works**:
People respond to direct, clear instructions. Ambiguity allows them to disengage.

---

### 23. Establish Why THEY Should Listen vs. Others

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: There are other people they could listen to. Why you?

**Kennedy's Truth**:
> "Most of us have comparables and competitors. So maybe I don't have a direct competitor, but there are clearly other people you could listen to about almost any subject that I ever talk about. So we have to hunt for the reason why you should listen to me versus all the others, as well as why you should listen to me."

**The Fran Tarkenton Example**:
> "The reason I'm so excited about talking to you about Think and Go Rich is because I'm a champion, I'm a winner, I've been all about winning my entire life, and I know what it takes to win, and here are 17 secrets about what it takes to win. If you don't do that, then you might as well have a completely irrelevant celebrity up there because you haven't hooked them together."

**When to Use**:
- Within first 10 minutes
- After establishing who you are
- Before making major claims

**How to Do It**:
Bridge your authority/celebrity/credibility to THIS specific topic for THIS specific audience.

---

### 24. Time Lie (always lie about elapsed time)

**Category**: 3.3 - Stay-Tuned Tactics
**Principle**: Always understate how much time has passed and how much is coming.

**Kennedy's Blunt Truth**:
> "We will often lie to them about the time because in the next 22 minutes, and it's really 48, in the next 22 minutes."

**From Page 86 of Source**:
> "Either from the stage or in canned presentations, I have never told the truth about this in my entire life. I always say in four minutes, and it's nine, and in just a few more minutes, and it's 20, and there's 17 minutes from now you go see and it's 22. They have a sense of time but they're not clocking you."

**Why It Works**:
> "You want to stretch them so if you tell them the truth they start to think about bailing out because gee 22 minutes is a long time 14 minutes that's not so much time."

**Examples**:
- "In the next few minutes..." (it's 20)
- "We're about halfway through..." (you're at 25%)
- "Just 10 more minutes..." (it's 23)
- "We've been together for about 20 minutes..." (it's been 40)

**When to Use**:
- Throughout entire presentation
- Every time you reference time
- When transitioning between sections

**Important**:
Better to be clumsy about this than not do it. People think in time blocks. Manage their perception.

---

## Kennedy's Key Principles for The Open

### 1. First 10 Minutes Determine Stay or Leave
The overwhelming majority who will leave do so in first 10 minutes. If you get them past this window, they'll likely stay for the entire presentation.

### 2. Assume They Know Nothing
Even with warm audiences who registered specifically to see you, assume they've forgotten who you are and why they're there.

> "The better known you are to your audience, the less of this you must establish, but you still ought not assume any of it as preexisting. If you assume it's there, even though we know each other, you will find it compromises your effectiveness."

### 3. Stop Checkout > Create Interest
Your first job is prevention. Stop them from leaving BEFORE you try to make them interested.

### 4. They Can Leave Anytime (Unlike One-to-One)
In one-to-one selling, social pressure keeps them there. In group selling (any media), they can leave without being rude.

### 5. Never Skip Establishment
Even if they came specifically to see you, even if they paid to be there, establish everything:
- Who you are
- Why you're talking about this
- Why NOW
- Why they should listen to YOU vs. others
- What they'll get for staying

### 6. Pre-Establishment Matters Most
The more you can get established BEFORE the presentation (through promotion, pre-event materials, host introduction), the less time you need to spend on it during the presentation.

**Kennedy's Speaker Mistake**:
> "Here's a mistake speakers make who go speak at other people's events. They leave all the pre-event stuff up to the host. They give them generic stuff. Everybody. I have yet, in all the years I've been on the other side of that, we're running an event, we hire a bunch of speakers, and speakers are coming, including the speakers who are coming to sell. So they should care deeply about what gets established for them before they get there. They send their generic stuff."

**His Solution**:
> "If I'm going to go work for Greg Stanton, Stanley and go do a dental group, I don't give them my generic stuff. I go get doctor testimonials and I go get my healthcare references and I give them promotional material about me that is directly relevant to their audience."

---

## How to Use These Frameworks

### The Sequence:

**Minutes 1-3: Stop Checkout**
1. Quick Promises (3-5)
2. Direct Specific Instruction
3. Personal Relevance (if tight audience)

**Minutes 3-7: Establish Who/Why**
4. Celebrity (if you have it)
5. Authority
6. Credibility
7. Affinity
8. Why You're Talking About This
9. Why NOW

**Minutes 7-10: Lock Them In**
10. Benefit Summary Statement
11. Why THEY Should Listen vs. Others
12. Time Lie about what's coming
13. Bribe to Stay Tuned (if using)

**Throughout: Prevention Tactics**
- Short-Circuit Instant Negatives (as needed)
- Frame the Presentation (early)
- Engage and Make Them Think (constantly)
- Breaking News/Threat/Loss (if applicable)

---

## Adapting to Different Audiences

### Cold vs. Warm Audience
**Cold**: Need MORE of everything in the open
**Warm**: Can shorten but never eliminate

### Source Quality
**High Quality** (dentists, CPAs, lawyers):
- Better attention span
- Need less repetition
- Can handle more complexity

**Low Quality** (general consumer, opportunity seeker):
- Shorter attention span
- Need more repetition
- Keep it simpler

### Age Demographics
**70+ year olds**: Once tuned in, they stay tuned in
**25 year olds**: Need constant re-engagement

### Physical Room vs. Distance
**Physical Room**: Can see you, can see others, social pressure to stay
**Webcast/DVD**: Alone, easy click-away, need stronger open

---

## Common Mistakes in The Open

### 1. Starting Too Slowly
Thinking you have time to "warm up" before the good stuff. You don't. They're gone.

### 2. Assuming They Know Who You Are
Even people who registered to see you specifically have forgotten by the time the presentation starts.

### 3. Over-Complicating
Trying to establish too many things, teach too much, give too much detail.

### 4. Leaving It to the Host
Giving generic promotional materials and assuming the host will establish you properly.

### 5. No Quick Promises
Diving into who you are before giving them any reason to care.

### 6. Weak Time Lie
Telling them "we're going to be together for 2 hours" in minute 1. They start looking for the exit.

### 7. Making Them Wrong
Insulting their current approach before establishing authority. They tune out defensively.

### 8. Forgetting "Why Now"
No timely relevance = "I can do this later" = they leave.

## Kennedy's Checklist for Your Open

Before you deliver any group presentation, verify you have:

- [ ] Something that stops checkout in first 90 seconds
- [ ] 3-5 quick promises stated clearly
- [ ] Who you are (celebrity/authority/credibility)
- [ ] Affinity with THIS audience
- [ ] Why you're talking about THIS topic
- [ ] Why you're talking about it NOW
- [ ] Why they should listen to YOU vs. others
- [ ] Personal relevance statement (if tight audience)
- [ ] Benefit summary statement
- [ ] Direct instruction to stay tuned
- [ ] Time lie about what's coming
- [ ] Short-circuited instant negatives
- [ ] Frame of what to expect

**If you're missing any of these, you're leaving money and results on the table.**

## Usage Notes

**Best for:**
- Any group selling presentation (any media)
- Cold or skeptical audiences
- Presentations where people can easily leave
- Webinars with high drop-off rates
- Understanding universal Open principles

**Not ideal for:**
- One-to-one selling (different dynamics)
- Presentations to captive audiences
- Pure education without selling

**Kennedy's Final Word**:
> "In any environment where they have an opportunity to abruptly stop it. So if they're in a group, they can get up and leave, and they can mentally tune out even if they are sitting there. If they have a clicker in their hand, they can obviously click. If they're online, they can go elsewhere online. So you have to be really sensitive to the idea that you can lose them very early and never really have an opportunity."

**The open is not optional. The open is not a warm-up. The open IS the battle.**
