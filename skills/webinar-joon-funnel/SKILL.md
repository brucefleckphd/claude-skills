# Joon Funnel & Ticket Sales Frameworks

Peng Joon's systematic approach to filling events through Facebook ads, retargeting, and speaking gigs. Built on 200+ events in 20+ countries.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building Facebook ad campaigns to fill live events
- Creating retargeting sequences for webinar/event funnels
- Acquiring testimonials for ad creatives
- Getting speaking gigs with major organizers
- Packaging event tickets with online courses
- Optimizing ad spend and average cart value

## Core Philosophy: The Event Codex Pillar 1

"The biggest differentiator in Facebook ads today is no longer about running ads to completely cold audiences, but rather starting the relationship by giving value first."

**Key Insight:** Retargeting is where the money is (10-20:1 ROI typical).

## Frameworks Included (8)

### Tier 1 (Foundational)
1. **Four-Step Facebook Ad Progression** - Value videos → Custom audiences → Funnel ads → Retargeting (where money is)
2. **Custom Audience Funnel Step Segmentation** - Create audiences for every funnel position, targeted ads for each
3. **Ideal Funnel Stack for Events** - Webinar → PLF backend → Free+shipping (acquire leads free)

### Tier 2 (Intermediate)
4. **Objection Video Retargeting Ads** - 3-5min videos answering ONE objection per ad (4:1 ROI)
5. **Testimonial Cart Abandonment Retargeting** - Only show testimonials to checkout abandoners (not cold traffic)
6. **Testimonial Acquisition Contest** - $1000 best / $100 if used = dozens of videos in days
7. **Getting Speaking Gigs Progression** - Webinars → Lunch sponsors → Pay-to-speak → Major organizers
8. **Event Tickets as Course Bonus Positioning** - Waive $4K tuition, charge $97 materials fee only if attend

### Tier 3 (Advanced)
- None in this skill (all practical execution frameworks)

## Framework Details

### 1. Four-Step Facebook Ad Progression

**Pattern:**
```
Cold Audience → Value Video (boosted to interests)
    ↓
25% Video Viewers → Custom Audience (semi-warm)
    ↓
Sales Funnel Ads (webinar or free+shipping)
    ↓
Retargeting Campaigns (10-20:1 ROI) ← WHERE THE MONEY IS
```

**Steps:**
1. Create value videos incorporating origin story
2. Boost to cold audiences (Toastmasters, Tony Robbins fans, etc.)
3. Create custom audience of 25% video viewers
4. Run funnel ads to semi-warm audience
5. Create retargeting for EVERY funnel step

**Why it works:** Value-first builds relationship. Retargeting captures fence-sitters at much lower cost.

**Example:** Speaking tips video → Tony Robbins audience → 25% viewers → webinar funnel → 20:1 ROI on retargeting

### 2. Custom Audience Funnel Step Segmentation

Create separate audience for EVERY position:
- Visited page but didn't register
- Registered but didn't show up
- Showed up but didn't checkout
- Checkout but didn't complete purchase
- Watched replay but didn't buy

**For each segment, create targeted ad:**
- Visited-no-register: "Did life get in the way? Click to register"
- Registered-no-show: "Click to watch replay"
- Showed-no-checkout: Objection-answering videos
- Checkout-abandon: Testimonial videos

**Result:** Push each segment to next funnel step with personalized message. Average 10-20:1 ROI.

**Critical:** This is where retargeting money is made, not top-of-funnel.

---

### 3. Ideal Funnel Stack for Event Filling

**Build Order (if starting from scratch):**

1. **Start:** Webinar funnel (2:1 ROI typical with decent close)
2. **Add:** Product Launch Formula backend
   - 3 value videos + 1 sales video
   - Catches fence-sitters who need more nurturing
3. **Final:** Free+shipping funnel
   - Hardest to execute profitably
   - Requires: strong order bump, OTO1, OTO2, members area
   - Target: $50+ average cart value
   - When ACV > ad cost = free leads

**Stack Effect:** Free+shipping generates free leads → webinar funnel = 100% profit → event backend = profit maximizer

**Why this order:** Webinar gives fastest feedback on offer. PLF nurtures warm leads. Free+shipping requires most work but makes other funnels free.

---

### 4. Objection Video Retargeting Ads

**DO NOT run to cold traffic.** Only to people who showed up to webinar or visited checkout.

**Process:**
1. List ALL objections (too shy, too old, too young, out of comfort zone, too expensive, etc.)
2. Create 3-5 minute video per objection
3. Share personal story overcoming that objection
4. Run ONLY to showed-up-didn't-checkout OR checkout-abandonment audiences
5. Link directly to checkout page

**Example Video Structure:**
"I noticed you came to my website but didn't order. Perhaps you thought speaking is not for you because you're shy/introverted. Let me share... I was the same way... but speaking is a learnable, trainable skill... The question is, are you willing to be bad at something in order to be good at something?"

**Results:** Typically 4:1 ROI on objection ads.

---

### 5. Testimonial Cart Abandonment Retargeting

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never run testimonials to cold traffic (causes trolling/negative comments).

**Strategy:**
- Collect 1000+ video testimonials (see leverage skill for acquisition method)
- Create custom audience: visited checkout but didn't purchase
- Run testimonials ONLY to this audience
- Rotate every 7-9 days (ad creative burnout)

**Why it works:** Fence-sitters who've seen offer just need social proof push. Cold audience isn't problem/solution aware yet.

**Example:** Brandon Poulin Lady Boss testimonial → Only shown to people who got to checkout → Closes fence-sitters

---

### 6. Testimonial Acquisition Contest

Inspired by Russell's ClickFunnels contest.

**Setup:**
1. Run ad to all past customers
2. Announce contest: $1000 for best testimonial
3. Add: $100 payment if we use your testimonial in ads
4. Provide sample video format
5. Collect dozens in less than a week

**Why it works:** Monetary incentive dramatically increases quality. People won't submit crappy videos when money involved. $100 per used ad is cheap compared to value.

**Result:** High-quality testimonials that rotate as retargeting creatives.

---

### 7. Getting Speaking Gigs Progression

**Organizers care about ONE thing: closing ratio.** Content speakers are everywhere. Closers are rare.

**Path (if starting over):**
1. **Master webinar closing first** (low-risk practice environment)
2. **Sponsor lunch sessions** (20-50 people at Traffic & Conversions, etc.)
3. **Pay-to-speak events** ($10K-$25K for 1000 people)
   - If you can close, this is ROI positive
   - "Would you pay $25K to close 1000 people? Yes."
4. **Build portfolio** with stats and closing ratios
5. **Approach major organizers** (Success Resources, etc.) with track record

**Truth:** You get one chance. Bomb = no second chance. So get good BEFORE approaching.

**Priority:** Don't look for organizer gigs until you can close on webinars consistently.

---

### 8. Event Tickets as Course Bonus Positioning

**WRONG WAY (creates objection):**
"For those who invest, you get 2 free tickets to my June 2-3 event."

**Problem:** They think: "Can I make it June 2-3?" → Additional objection created.

**RIGHT WAY:**
"For those who invest, I'm waiving the $4000 tuition fee. You only cover $97 materials fee when you actually attend."

**Why it works:**
- Separates purchase decision from attendance decision
- They don't lose $97 if they can't attend
- Can attend next event instead
- Increases perceived value without creating objection

**Result:** Dramatically higher conversion by removing attendance-date objection.

## Hell Island to Heaven Island (Bonus Framework)

**Three-Part Messaging Strategy:**

All content should address:
1. **Hell Island:** Pain of present (where they are now)
2. **Heaven Island:** Vision of future (where they want to be)
3. **Sharks (Objections):** What prevents crossing

**Balance:** Rotate videos between pain, vision, and objection-crushing. Carrot alone is weak. Stick alone is depressing. Need both + objection removal.

**Symptom vs Pain:** Point to specific symptoms, not general pain.
- Weak: "Struggling with Facebook ads?"
- Strong: "Is your Facebook relevancy score under 6?"

Symptoms are observable. Those who relate say "That's me!"
