# Brunson Architecture Frameworks

Foundation frameworks for Perfect Webinar strategic positioning and overall structure.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a webinar's strategic positioning and price point
- Understanding the build order (offer before script!)
- Learning the Perfect Webinar three-act structure
- Deciding if webinars are right for your situation
- Understanding the leverage potential of webinar model
- Adapting scripts between stage and webinar formats

## Frameworks Included (12)

### Master Systems (Tier 1)
- **B1. Perfect Webinar Three-Act Structure** - Introduction, Content, Close structure tested over 10 years
- **B2. The Perfect Webinar Template** - Physical checklist sheet that ensures all critical elements included

### Supporting Frameworks (Tier 2)
- **B3. Offer Creation Before Script** - Build irresistible offer FIRST (2+ hours), then craft webinar around it
- **B4. The Webinar Emergency Cash Generation** - Real case study: $150K in 24 hours when business collapsed
- **B5. The Fastest Money-Making Method Positioning** - Webinar as ultimate leverage tool once list exists

### Refinement Frameworks (Tier 3)
- **B6. Webinar Price Point Range** - $500-$2,500 sweet spot (below: front-end funnels, above: phone sales)
- **B7. The Million Dollar Seminar Discovery** - Origin story: $50K per 90-min presentation economics
- **B8. The Content vs Sales Event Distinction** - Paid events = pure teaching, free webinars = selling expected
- **B9. The List Requirement for Webinar Success** - Build front-end funnel first if no list exists
- **B10. The Whiteboard Offer Session** - No-filter brainstorming: everything possible before filtering
- **B11. The Stage-to-Webinar Script Universality** - Same script works both contexts (energy delivery differs)
- **B12. The 90-Minute Perfect Webinar Timeframe** - Optimal length: enough value, maintains attention

## How to Use

1. **Validate Approach** - Use B6 (Price Point Range) and B9 (List Requirement) to confirm webinars are right approach
2. **Build Offer First** - Use B3 (Offer Creation) and B10 (Whiteboard Session) to create irresistible offer BEFORE building presentation
3. **Apply Structure** - Use B1 (Three-Act Structure) and B2 (Template) to plan webinar architecture
4. **Understand Leverage** - Use B4 (Emergency Cash) and B7 (Million Dollar Discovery) to grasp the economic model
5. **Build Sections** - Move to section-specific element skills

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Core Architecture Principle

**BUILD IN THIS ORDER (Not presentation order!):**

```
STEP 1: CREATE OFFER (2+ hours minimum)
├─ Whiteboard session: "What if I needed $1,000 today?"
├─ Map core program (6-8 modules)
├─ Add irresistible bonuses
└─ Only THEN start building presentation

STEP 2: BUILD WEBINAR USING THREE-ACT STRUCTURE

INTRODUCTION (~15 min)
├─ Build rapport
├─ Establish authority
├─ Set frame
└─ Create hooks

CONTENT (~45 min)
├─ Deliver useful teaching
├─ Position product as necessary next step
└─ Build value and create gap

CLOSE (~30 min)
├─ Present offer
├─ Handle objections
├─ Create urgency
└─ Call to action

TARGET: 90 minutes total
PRICE RANGE: $500-$2,500 optimal
REQUIREMENT: Existing list (build front-end funnel first if none)
```

## Key Strategic Insights

### The Build Order Rule
"When I was at their event, it was interesting, or at the power day that I paid $10,000 to be at, the first probably two hours of that process was figuring out the offer."

**Offer first, presentation second.** This is non-negotiable.

### The Price Point Strategy
- Under $500: Front-end sales funnels (free plus shipping to $100)
- $500-$2,500: Webinars (education + relationship building for 4-figure purchases)
- Above $2,500: Backend phone sales (high-ticket processes)

### The List Pre-Requisite
"If I had a product, or if I had a list of people, and usually for a webinar to work, you gotta have a list, right?"

If starting from zero: Build front-end funnel to create list FIRST, then use webinar to monetize.

### The Emergency Leverage Test
"If someone said make $100K tomorrow or they'd kidnap my family, I'd do a webinar."

This positions webinar as the fastest cash generation tool once foundation (list + offer) exists.
