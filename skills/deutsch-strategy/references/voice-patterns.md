## THE DEUTSCH STRATEGY VOICE

### Core Principle
Access your inner persuader, not your inner writer. Don't WRITE - TALK on the page.

### The Just Talk Standard
"I don't really train people to write so much as I train people to kind of access that part in their brain that knows how to persuade and get words down on paper."

## THE 4 C's VOICE PATTERNS

### 1. Clarity Voice
Is it easy to understand?
- Caveman simple
- Would Mom understand?
- No jargon
- 12-year-old test

**Check:** "Can they understand while distracted?"

### 2. Compelling Voice
Does it draw them in?
- Head engaged (interesting)
- Heart engaged (feel something)
- Both intellectual AND emotional

**Check:** "Am I advancing BOTH journeys?"

### 3. Credible Voice
Is it believable?
- Proof present
- Mechanism explained
- Authority cited
- Specific, not vague

**Check:** "Would I believe this if I were skeptical?"

### 4. Change Voice
Will their life be DIFFERENT?
- Not just improvement - TRANSFORMATION
- Not just better - DIFFERENT PERSON
- Life will never be the same

**Check:** "Am I promising transformation, not just benefit?"

## THE 2 H's VOICE PATTERNS

### 1. Honest Voice
Would you say this to your mother?
- No exaggeration she'd call out
- No claims you can't back
- Truth more powerful than hype

**Pattern:** "Dear Mom, here's why you should..."

### 2. Heart-to-Heart Voice
Speaking from YOUR heart to THEIR heart:
- You care about them
- You're not just selling
- Genuine concern
- Personal connection

**Check:** "Am I speaking TO them, not AT them?"

---

## BIG IDEA VOICE

### What It Sounds Like
A new perspective, not just a claim:
- "Why French women never get fat" (curiosity, not claim)
- "The end of America" (big idea, not product pitch)
- Changes how they THINK about the problem

### How to Find It
Keep asking: "What do we do that's DIFFERENT?"
- Dig relentlessly
- Client doesn't know what's cool
- Keep asking until gold appears
- The obvious is often invisible

---

## MECHANISM VOICE

### What It Sounds Like
HOW you do it, not just WHAT you do:
- "Lose weight by balancing your hormones"
- "Make money using the [named system]"
- "Thanks to this [specific method]"

### When You Need It
- Stage 3+ market sophistication
- Claims alone aren't working
- Need to differentiate from competitors

---

## RESEARCH VOICE

### The Research Advantage
"Research is what powers better copywriting. Anyone can research more. That's your competitive advantage."

### What to Research
- The science (technical knowledge)
- The psychology (emotional reality)
- The audience (fears, desires, language)
- The competition (what are they saying?)

---

## FLOW THEN STRUCTURE

### Phase 1: Flow
- Just write
- Don't stop
- Bad ideas welcome
- Get it all out

### Phase 2: Structure
- Organize what you wrote
- Cut the dead parts
- Arrange the living parts
- Polish and refine

"When you first get a new idea, flow is better. Just keep writing, writing, writing. Don't stop."
