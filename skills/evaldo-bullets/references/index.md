## Core Bullet Methods

| bullets-page-number | Tangibility technique | Physical/digital products |

## Bullet Structure

| Framework | Description | Use When |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| bullets-types | Different approaches | Varying bullet style |
| bullets-what-why-how | Multiplying from one idea | Need more bullets |
| bullets-stacking | Ordering for impact | Arranging bullet lists |

## The Core Formula

**CURIOSITY + BENEFIT**

Every bullet needs both:
- CURIOSITY: The open loop that hooks them
- BENEFIT: The outcome they'll get

"The [curiosity element] that [benefit]..."

## The Parenthesis Amplifier

Add impact with parenthetical:
- (this one thing changed everything)
- (page 47)
- (you probably have this in your kitchen)
- (hint: it's not what you think)

## Quick Filter

Before using ANY bullet, ask:
1. Is there genuine curiosity?
2. Is the benefit clear?
3. Is there specificity?
4. Would I want to know more?
