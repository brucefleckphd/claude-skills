## THE EVALDO BULLET VOICE

### Core Principle
Every bullet is a mini-headline. Curiosity plus benefit. The curiosity hooks them, the benefit sells them. A great bullet can sell the product by itself.

### The Bullet Mindset
- Each bullet is standalone
- Hook immediately
- Promise specifically
- Create open loops

- "What [authority] knows..."

**Weak (No Hook):**
