## NLP Transition Patterns (Tier 3)

### T1. NLP Triple Fact Transition
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Three undeniable facts that lead naturally to the offer
**When to Use:** Creating structured transition from teaching to selling
**Key Insight:** Start with what they cannot deny, build logical sequence that makes offer feel inevitable. Fact 1: what they learned. Fact 2: how it applies. Fact 3: the question of implementation.

### T2. NLP Psychic Transmission Transition
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** "I know what you're thinking right now..."
**When to Use:** Anticipating and addressing objections before they're voiced
**Key Insight:** Demonstrates you understand them, validates their thoughts, lowers resistance. Follow with exact thought they're having, acknowledge it's valid, then offer solution.

### T3. NLP Global Pattern Transition
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Universal human pattern everyone recognizes
**When to Use:** Creating identification and setting up choice between doing it alone vs. with help
**Key Insight:** "Everyone who [achieves result] does [pattern]" creates universal recognition. Then present the fork: struggle alone or get help.

### T4. Stacked NLP Transitions
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Combining multiple NLP patterns for compound effect
**When to Use:** When single pattern isn't enough, or for high-ticket offers
**Key Insight:** Layer patterns sequentially. Global Pattern → Psychic Transmission → Triple Fact → Hype-Free Bridge. Each amplifies the next. More powerful than single pattern.

## Alternative Approaches (Tier 3-4)

### T5. Dave Dee's Hype-Free (Non-Sales) Transition
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Never use "sales pitch" language
**When to Use:** Avoiding resistance from sophisticated or pitch-weary audiences
**Key Insight:** Never say "Now for my pitch" or "Let me sell you." Instead: "Here's what I want to do for you" or "Let me show you how to get this done faster." Offer IS part of helping.

### T6. Exact System Offer Transition
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Natural bridge to offering the exact system you use
**When to Use:** After teaching principles, transitioning to offering complete implementation system
**Key Insight:** "That's the strategy. Here's the exact system I use to implement it." Frames offer as natural next step, not separate "thing to buy."

### T7. Embedded Commands with Tonal Emphasis
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** Subtle influence through emphasized words within sentences
**When to Use:** Throughout transition to plant suggestions subconsciously
**Key Insight:** Emphasize key action phrases within longer sentences using tonal shift. "And what you'll NOTICE as you CONSIDER THIS is..." Brain hears emphasized portions as commands while conscious mind processes full sentence.
