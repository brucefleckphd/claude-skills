# John Carlton Voice Patterns

## The Bar Room Conversation Voice

Carlton's voice is like explaining something to a friend in a bar. Casual, direct, conversational - but packed with salesmanship.

### Core Voice Characteristics

1. **First Person Always** - "I", "me", "my" - by the close they should feel like they know you
2. **Casual Colloquialism** - "ain't gonna happen", "you're gonna", "here's the deal"
3. **Specific Over General** - Never "I'm a parent", always "I'm a parent with three kids, one in jail and two in kindergarten"
4. **No Throat Clearing** - Start where the action is, cut warming-up paragraphs
5. **Action Verbs** - Dynamic language that creates movement
6. **Mini-Stories** - Every bullet, every example should be a tiny story

## Bullet Formula Patterns

### The One-Two Punch

Every bullet should have:
1. **Punch One:** Satisfying practical use OR positioning statement
2. **Punch Two:** Little tweak of shock and delight OR direct assault on common sense

### Bullet Templates from Carlton's Actual Copy

**The Positioning + Benefit:**
> "Very easy tactic to double your profits overnight! (An astoundingly easy technique well used by smart businessmen... but ignored by 99% of other marketers!)"

**The Journey Bullet:**
> "Move like lightning through the 3 stages of guitar mastery: From 'no clue at all' to 'this is easy' in just a few short hours... and then on through 'impress all your friends to the point you scare them', straight to 'ready for the stage'."

**The Named Technique:**
> "The amazing 'Lazy Businessman's 3-Step Shortcut' to creating your first world-class ad."

**The Blind Curiosity:**
> "The one envelope that no one in the history of civilization has ever NOT opened!"

**The Parenthetical Nudge:**
> "How to hit ALL of her 'long overdue' hot buttons... at the exact right moment. (And finally explore NEW spots of intense titillation she never knew she had!)"

### Naming Things (Advanced)

Add perceived value by naming simple concepts:
- "The Function of Seduction"
- "The Lazy Businessman's 3-Step Shortcut"
- "The Zombie State"
- "The Greased Slide"
- "The A-Brain"

## Testimonial Voice Patterns

### Short, Specific, Spicy

**Bad Testimonial:**
> "Anne's a great person and I really enjoyed working with her..."
- Focuses on person, not results
- Not specific
- No numbers, no outcome

**Good Testimonial:**
> "$287,000 the first week! After listening to John for less than an hour, my mind caught fire and everything fell into place. I immediately produced my first sales letter ever... and it brought in $287,000 the first week!" - Rich Schefren

### Voice Authenticity

- Each testimonial should sound like a DIFFERENT person wrote it
- Don't clean up grammar too much - real people don't speak perfectly
- Include their verbal tics and expressions
- Numbers and specifics beat vague praise every time

---

## Close Voice Patterns

### The "Here's The Deal" Close

Structure:
1. **Here's the deal** - Summarize the offer clearly
2. **Here's what you get** - List everything included
3. **Here's what it costs** - Price presentation
4. **Here's your guarantee** - Risk reversal
5. **Here's what to do now** - Specific action steps

### Assume The Sale

Never hedge. Never apologize. Of course they're going to buy.

**Wrong:**
> "If you'd like to maybe possibly consider ordering..."

**Right:**
> "Get out your wallet. Go to PayPal and fill out the form. I just want you to know you are under no obligation to keep this."

### First Person Intimacy

By the close, write as if you've been having a conversation all along:
> "Look, you and I both know..."
> "Between you and me..."
> "I'm going to be straight with you..."

## Voice Quality Checklist

Before submitting any Carlton-style copy, verify:

### Bar Room Test
- [ ] Could this be read aloud in a bar without sounding stiff?
- [ ] Is it first person throughout the close?
- [ ] Are specifics used instead of generalities?
- [ ] Is there throat-clearing in the opening that should be cut?

### A-Brain Test
- [ ] Are emotional triggers present (greed, fear, ego, lust, revenge, curiosity)?
- [ ] Is there a one-two punch (emotional + rational)?
- [ ] Does it wake them from zombie state?

### Hook Test
- [ ] Is there incongruous juxtaposition?
- [ ] Does the hook create cognitive dissonance?
- [ ] Does it immediately transition to credibility?

### So What Test
- [ ] After each paragraph, can you answer "So what?"
- [ ] Does every section serve the reader's self-interest?
- [ ] Is there a clear reason to keep reading?

### Go-To Guy Test
- [ ] Is it selling from the front foot, not the heels?
- [ ] Does it position you as THE authority?
- [ ] Is the sale assumed, not begged for?
