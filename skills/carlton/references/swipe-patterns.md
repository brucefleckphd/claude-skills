**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

### D.2 Benefits vs. Features
**Quote**: "Basically, every good sales pitch is targeted at the benefits of the product, not the features. It doesn't matter if the product is big, small, blue, green or yellow. What does matter — and it's the ONLY thing that matters — is what the product will do for the human being using it."
**Application**: Carlton's fundamental selling principle.
**Use with**: `carlton-features-benefits`

**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`

### D.4 Professional vs. Amateur
**Quote**: "The professional 'captures' every perfect shot he ever hits, and stores it in his system, where he can find it again when he's playing 'for real.' You, however, blow right past the few perfect shots you hit on the range, not storing them at all."

**Application**: Proof trumps credentials.
**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`, `carlton-testimonials`

### P.2 The Long Copy Principle
**Quote**: "When I tell other copywriters I forced bodybuilders to read a 16-page letter, they just stare at me and blink... Let this be the stake through that vampire's heart.

**Application**: Length is irrelevant if you hit the passion point.
**Use with**: `carlton-structure`

### P.3 The Urgency Principle

**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`

### P.6 The "You Can't Figure It Out On Your Own" Principle

**Quote**: "What's missing... is... The Simple, Ugly, Violent and QUICK Mindset of Forcing Bad Men To Respect You!"

**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

### P.9 The Flirt Technique
**Quote**: "So, a great sales pitch teases your brain with glimpses of what's in store. It's a hazy picture, somewhat vague. You can't make out the details very well. But you get a good sense of what it will feel like... Tease, tease, tease. Sometimes, I'm just the most shameful flirt in copywriting."
**Application**: Never reveal the product, only the transformation feeling.
**Use with**: `carlton-bullets`

**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`

### CI.6 The "Cheapies Never Convert" vs. "Passion Index" Insight

**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`

### MT.2 The Buried Treasure Metaphor
**Quote**: "Golfers love the idea that greatness is hiding inside their swing already. And that it won't take much work at all to release it. Sort of like rubbing a lamp and freeing the genie inside."
**Application**: Positions the secret as unlocking what's already there, not building something new.
**Use with**: `carlton-psychology`

## SUCCESS PATTERNS (6 patterns)

### SP.1 The Choice Pattern
**Quote**: "Also, notice the clever way 'choice' is introduced into the offer. Most deals have a designated freebie and a designated main product. This is different. Different, but not complicated."
**Application**: Instead of "buy both, keep one free," offer "you choose which one to keep." Psychological ownership increases.
**Use with**: `carlton-offers`

### SP.2 The Numbering System Pattern
**Quote**: "If I'd tried to tell a story incorporating all these points, the letter would have been 16 pages long. I write long copy, but not if the same thing can be said in a shorter and more pithy way. I call this technique 'pithifying the pitch'."
**Application**: When you have multiple complex points, number them 1-11 in logical sequence.
**Use with**: `carlton-structure`

### SP.3 The Handwritten Notes Pattern
**Quote**: "This goes back to the concept of 'humanizing' your letters. The handwritten notes and circles are in a different color... as if the writer had grabbed the typeset letter just before it left for the printer, and scribbled last-minute thoughts all over it."
**Application**: Add handwritten circles, brackets, exclamation marks in margins.
**Use with**: `carlton-structure`

**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

## FAILURE PATTERNS (4 patterns)

### FP.1 The Censored Product Failure
**Quote**: "The client actually had the goods — he had learned some pretty remarkable insights and tactics in the mating game, and was very successful with the ladies. But he couldn't write to save his life. So he hired the nice Catholic boy... who promptly censored everything the client told him."
**Application**: Great copy can't save a censored product. The ad pulled like crazy, but refunds killed it because the book sucked.
**Use with**: `carlton-research`

### FP.2 The "Dating the Ad" Failure Pattern
**Quote**: "Often, I don't like to use 'timely' things in my headlines, or in my copy. Because it 'dates' the ad... and when the memory of that event fades, the ad loses power."
**Application**: Timely hooks pull big initially but die fast. Evergreen principles last 5+ years.
**Use with**: `carlton-hooks`

### FP.3 The "Over-Writing" Failure Pattern
**Quote**: "I was NOT a world-class writer when I penned this ad. However... you can see the seeds of genius in it. I did not try to over-write... as so many 'not yet great' writers do."
**Application**: Beginners over-write. Pros write simple and clear.
**Use with**: `carlton-voice`

### FP.4 The Executive Love Warning
**Quote**: "I should have known something was wrong when word started leaking back to me that executives there really loved my latest manuscript."
**Application**: If corporate suits love it, it probably isn't edgy enough to sell. Good copy makes them nervous.
**Use with**: `carlton-voice`

## DIAGNOSTICS (4 patterns)

### DG.1 The Empathy Litmus Test
**Quote**: "Empathy. I had empathy. Hey, I'm an empathetic kinda guy... But Gary didn't see it that way. He'd learned his salesman's chops in the mean streets of real experience with real customers. And he knew empathy when he saw it."
**Application**: If a street-smart salesman doesn't feel the empathy, it's not there yet. Keep revising.
**Use with**: `carlton-research`

### DG.2 The "One Thing" Diagnostic
**Quote**: "I want every ad to be the one thing he reads that stays with him all day long. He tells his friends about it. It haunts him, causes him to shake his head in wonder, gooses his brain and gets his blood flowing."
**Application**: If your ad doesn't haunt the reader, it's not good enough.
**Use with**: `carlton-voice`

### DG.3 The Putting Diagnostic Table
**Example**: "YOUR SCORE NOW: 126 / # OF PUTTS: 50 / # OF PUTTS AFTER WATCHING THIS NEW VIDEO: 36 / YOUR SCORE: 108."
