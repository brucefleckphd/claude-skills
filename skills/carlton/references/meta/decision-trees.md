## Hook Decision Tree

```
What's your market situation?

You have an underdog story
├── Use Weakness + Amazing Result template
│   "How a [weak person] [achieved amazing thing]"
│
└── Example: "How a skinny little golf genius..."

You have insider knowledge
├── Use Unlikely Source + Secret template
│   "How a [unlikely person] discovered..."
│
└── Example: "How a blind golfer stumbled onto..."

You have a dramatic transformation
├── Use They Laughed... Until template
│   "They [mocked]... until [triumph]"
│
└── Example: "The naked girls all laughed..."

You have hidden information
├── Use Hidden Knowledge template
│   "What [authority] secretly [knows]..."
│
└── Example: "What women secretly wish..."

You're addressing negative avoidance
├── Use Reverse Attention Grabber template
│   "How to guarantee you're never..."
│
└── Example: "...never the guy playing butt-ugly golf"
```

---

## Bullet Decision Tree

```
What's the purpose of this bullet?

Establish positioning
├── Use Positioning + Benefit template
│   "[Positioning] + (Parenthetical expansion)"
│
└── Example: "Very easy tactic... (ignored by 99%!)"

Show transformation journey
├── Use Journey Bullet template
│   "From [bad] to [good] to [amazing]"
│
└── Example: "From 'no clue' to 'ready for stage'"

Name a technique for perceived value
├── Use Named Technique template
│   "The '[Name]' that..."
│
└── Example: "The 'Lazy Businessman's 3-Step Shortcut'"

Create pure curiosity
├── Use Blind Curiosity template
│   "The one [thing] that..."
│
└── Example: "The one envelope no one has ever NOT opened"

Add titillating detail
├── Use Parenthetical Nudge template
│   "[Main benefit]... (And [extra]!)"
│
└── Example: "Hit her hot buttons... (And explore NEW spots!)"

Build goodwill with free value
├── Use Giveaway Bullet
│   Reveal actual useful information
│
└── Purpose: Prove you have real value
```

---

## Close Decision Tree

```
What's missing from your close?

No clear summary of offer
└── Add Part 1: "Here's the deal"
    Summarize everything clearly

No value stack
└── Add Part 2: "Here's what you get"
    List everything with values

Price feels too high
└── Add Part 3: Price with contrast
    Compare to total value

Risk feels too high
└── Add Part 4: "Here's your guarantee"
    Reverse all risk

No clear action steps
└── Add Part 5: "Here's what to do now"
    Walk through each step

Hedging/apologetic language
└── Fix: Assume the sale
    Remove "maybe", "if you want", etc.

Feels impersonal
└── Add first-person intimacy
    "You and I both know..."
```

---

## Testimonial Decision Tree

```
Is your testimonial weak?

Too long
└── Cut to essential result
    Maximum 2-3 sentences

Too vague
└── Add specific numbers
    Exact results, timeframes, amounts

No emotional punch
└── Add spicy language
    Their actual words, personality

Sounds like same person wrote all
└── Vary the voices
    Different people speak differently

Focuses on feelings not results
└── Reorient to outcomes
    What happened, not how they felt
```

---

## A-Brain Trigger Selection

```
What does your prospect need to feel?

They want MORE
└── Trigger: GREED
    Words: score big, windfall, jackpot, shortcut

They're afraid of LOSS
└── Trigger: FEAR
    Words: warning, danger, exposed, vulnerable

They want RESPECT
└── Trigger: EGO/PRIDE
    Words: impress, dominate, prove them wrong

They want SATISFACTION
└── Trigger: LUST/DESIRE
    Words: irresistible, ultimate, peak

They want JUSTICE
└── Trigger: REVENGE/VINDICATION
    Words: show them, payback, triumph

They want EASE
└── Trigger: LAZINESS
    Words: automatic, effortless, done for you
```
