# Fladlien Content Frameworks

Complete framework set for the teaching section (45% of webinar)—psychology, structure, emotional engagement, and commitment building.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing or improving webinar content sections
- Structuring teaching for maximum impact
- Engaging emotions during teaching
- Building commitment throughout content
- Transforming knowing into FEELING

**Important:** Build your content SECOND (after close, before intro)!

## Frameworks Included (15)

### Master Systems (Ace)
- **C2. Knowing-Feeling Distinction** - "It's not what you know, it's how you FEEL"
- **C4. Six Emotional Levers** - Fear, Confusion, Enthusiasm, Safety, Anger, Loneliness
- **C10. CVCS Method** - Context → Vision → Commitment → Strategy (per step)
- **C13. Commitment Spectrum** - 150 yeses before the ask (Macro→Micro, Direct→Indirect, Hard→Soft)

### Core Frameworks (King)
- **C1. Value Paradox** - "Less is more—they want ONE clear path, not four"
- **C7. Clearly Defined Outcome** - Audience + Feeling + Result = Precision
- **C15. 1-2-3 Commitment Formula** - Broad → Specific → Big commitment

### Solid Frameworks (Queen)
- **C3. Ecological Check Protocol** - 6 questions to validate content impact
- **C6. Loneliness Connection** - "Quiet desperation" is concealed
- **C11. Vision Story Types** - Slice of life + Micro-stories

### Supporting Frameworks (Jack/10)
- **C5. Anger Redirect** - Get them mad at failures (not at you)
- **C8. 3-to-5 Step Constraint** - No less than 3, no more than 5
- **C9. Roadmap Reveal** - Show map, mark progress as you go
- **C12. Steps vs Criteria Decision** - Sequential vs. factors to consider
- **C14. Triple Yes Technique** - Three questions, all answered yes

## How to Use

1. **Understand Philosophy** - Study C2 (Knowing-Feeling) to grasp the meta-principle
2. **Define Outcome** - Use C7 (Clearly Defined Outcome) to get precision
3. **Constrain Structure** - Use C8 (3-to-5 Constraint) to limit steps
4. **Apply CVCS** - Use C10 (CVCS Method) for each step
5. **Engage Emotions** - Use C4 (Six Emotional Levers) throughout
6. **Build Commitments** - Use C13-C15 to get 150 yeses
7. **Validate** - Use C3 (Ecological Check) on all content

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for categorized list with one-line descriptions.

## The CVCS Method (Master Framework)

**For each of your 3-5 steps, use this structure:**

### 1. CONTEXT (Why this step matters)
- The problem it solves
- What happens without it
- Why now is the time

### 2. VISION (What success looks like)
- Slice-of-life story (them succeeding)
- Your micro-story (proof it works for you)
- Customer micro-story (proof it works for others)
- Future pacing (make them FEEL it)

### 3. COMMITMENT (Get buy-in BEFORE strategy)
- Macro to micro questions
- Direct to indirect asks
- Hard to soft commitments
- Building toward 150 total yeses

### 4. STRATEGY (How to do it)
- Clear, specific steps
- Simple frameworks
- Actionable insights

**Key Insight:** Get commitment to the IDEA before revealing HOW. Once committed, they're invested in learning the strategy.

## The Six Emotional Levers

**Complete emotional toolkit for webinar teaching:**

1. **FEAR**
   - Make fear of inaction > fear of trying
   - Used in: Problem agitation, objection handling, transition

2. **CONFUSION**
   - Eliminate with clarity and roadmap
   - Used in: Structure, CVCS, Roadmap Reveal

3. **ENTHUSIASM**
   - Build excitement about possibility
   - Used in: Vision stories, future pacing, transformation

4. **SAFETY**
   - Create psychological safety to try
   - Used in: Authority, testimonials, ecological check

5. **ANGER**
   - Redirect at failures (not at you)
   - Used in: Problem agitation, us-vs-them framing

6. **LONELINESS**
   - Connect through shared struggle
   - Used in: Then-and-Now, community creation, understanding

## The Commitment Spectrum

**The 150 Yeses Principle:**

By the time you ask them to buy, they've already said "yes" 150 times.

**Three Dimensions:**

1. **Macro → Micro**
   - "Want better life?" → "Will you click this button?"

2. **Direct → Indirect**
   - Questions, agreements, acknowledgments

3. **Hard → Soft**
   - Written/public → Nods/agreement

**In Content Section:** Get 60-80 yeses using C14 (Triple Yes) and C15 (1-2-3 Commitment)

## Core Content Principles

1. **Knowing-Feeling Distinction** - Transform information into emotional experience
2. **Value Paradox** - Less content = more impact (they want ONE path)
3. **3-to-5 Constraint** - Never fewer than 3 steps, never more than 5
4. **Ecological Check** - Validate all content against 6 questions
5. **Commitment Before Strategy** - Get buy-in to idea before revealing how

## The Content Build Sequence

```
1. Define Outcome (C7) - Audience + Feeling + Result
   ↓
2. Constrain Steps (C8) - Choose 3-5 strategic steps
   ↓
3. Check Value Paradox (C1) - Can you remove anything?
   ↓
4. Apply CVCS to Each Step (C10) - Context → Vision → Commitment → Strategy
   ↓
5. Layer Emotions (C4) - Engage all six levers strategically
   ↓
6. Build Commitments (C13-C15) - Work toward 150 yeses
   ↓
7. Add Roadmap (C9) - Show progress throughout
   ↓
8. Validate (C3) - Run through Ecological Check
```

## Validation Questions

**Before finalizing content, ask:**

- Does this make my close feel inevitable? (Content → Close alignment)
- Have I honored the Value Paradox? (Is it TOO much content?)
- Am I transforming knowing into FEELING? (C2)
- Are all six emotions engaged strategically? (C4)
- Will I get 60-80 yeses in this section? (C13)
- Does each step use CVCS structure? (C10)
