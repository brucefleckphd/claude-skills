# Weekly Planning

Review the upcoming week, identify time blocks, schedule priority work, and set weekly commitments. Best done Sunday evening or Monday morning.

## Process

### Phase 1: Gather Weekly Context

**Read the following files:**

1. Daily notes from the previous week (for habit tracking)
2. Monthly to-do list (for pending tasks)
3. Calendar information (user provides meeting schedule)

**Ask the user:**

1. "What meetings do you have scheduled this week? (Include days, times, and whether mandatory or flexible)"
2. "Are there any personal commitments, appointments, or family activities this week?"
3. "What are your top 3 priorities for this week?"
4. "Are there any deadlines this week?"

### Phase 2: Review Previous Week

Generate habit summary from previous week's daily notes:

| Habit | M | T | W | T | F | S | S | Score |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Exercise | | | | | | | | /7 |
| Meditate | | | | | | | | /7 |
| Read | | | | | | | | /7 |
| Diet | | | | | | | | /7 |
| Lead Gen | | | | | | | | /5 (weekdays) |

**Weekly Reflection Questions:**

Ask these questions to prompt thoughtful review:

1. **"What went well last week?"**
   - (Looking for: wins, successes, things to repeat)

2. **"What could have gone better?"**
   - (Looking for: obstacles, missed opportunities, areas for improvement)

3. **"What could you have delegated to other people?"**
   - (Looking for: tasks that didn't require your direct involvement, team leverage)

4. **"What could you have delegated to AI?"**
   - (Looking for: repetitive tasks, research, drafting, analysis that AI could handle)

5. **"Where could you have found more leverage without more effort?"**
   - (Looking for: systems, automation, processes, templates, batching opportunities)

### Phase 3: Map Available Time

**Identify time blocks for each day:**

| Day | Meetings (Mandatory) | Meetings (Flexible) | Available Blocks |
|-----|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Mon | | | |
| Tue | | | |
| Wed | | | |
| Thu | | | |
| Fri | | | |
| Sat | | | |
| Sun | | | |

### Phase 4: Schedule Priority Work

**Apply priority ranking:**

1. Cook Medical (urgent/deadline)
2. Cook Medical (flexible timing)
3. AIBC - Client Service
4. AIBC - Prospecting/Lead Gen
5. BruceFleck.com
6. AI Systems Building

**Block time for:**
- Daily exercise (morning, ideally 7-8am)
- Daily lead gen (3pm target)
- Deep work blocks for priority projects
- Protected personal time (lunch, dinner, evening wind-down)

### Phase 5: Set Weekly Commitments

Ask:
- "What do you commit to completing this week for Cook Medical?"
- "What's your lead gen target this week? (contacts, conversations)"
- "Any specific AIBC client deliverables due?"
- "Anything for BruceFleck.com or personal development?"

## Integration

After generating the plan, offer:

1. "Would you like me to create a weekly note file with this plan?"
2. "Should I add time blocks to your calendar?"

**Weekly Note Location:**

| Cook Medical team meetings | As scheduled | Mandatory |

## Constraints

### NEVER DO:
- Schedule work over protected personal time without explicit permission
- Ignore Cook Medical deadlines
- Skip the habit review from previous week
- Overload days with unrealistic expectations

### ALWAYS DO:
- Protect morning exercise window
- Include daily lead gen time
- Account for energy patterns (deep work in AM, admin in low energy)
- Leave buffer time for unexpected items
- Review previous week before planning new week
