# Evaldo Philosophy

Evaldo Albuquerque's foundational philosophy and mindset frameworks. Evaldo is one of Agora's most successful financial copywriters, known for his systematic approach to copy that converts. His methodology centers on the One Belief Formula and treating VSLs as mini-movies.

## When to Use This Skill

- Before starting any copy project (filter your idea)
- When your idea isn't resonating
- When developing copywriter mindset
- When copy feels "off" but you can't identify why
- Before writing to ensure your angle passes all filters

## Crown Jewels

### 1. The Croc Brain Filters
Before your message reaches the thinking brain, it must pass through the primitive "croc brain" that controls attention. Three filters:

1. **Lion/Rabbit Filter** - Is this a threat or opportunity? (Creates urgency)
2. **Geico Filter** - Is this simple or complex? (Simple = actionable)
3. **Curiosity Filter** - Is this new or familiar? (New = attention)

If your message fails ANY filter, it gets ignored before conscious thought begins.

### 2. The Three Box Idea Check
Every winning idea must check ALL three boxes:
- [ ] **Emotional** - Does it move you emotionally?
- [ ] **Simple** - Can a child understand it?
- [ ] **New** - Has your prospect never seen this before?

Miss one box = weak promotion. Miss two = bomb.

### 3. The One Belief Formula
The 16-word foundation of all persuasion:
> "This new opportunity is the key to their desire and it's only attainable through my new mechanism."

Everything in your copy supports THIS ONE belief. Every sentence, every proof point, every story.

## Frameworks Included (8)

- philosophy-one-belief
- philosophy-croc-brain
- philosophy-three-box
- philosophy-domination-mindset
- philosophy-13-things
- philosophy-vsl-mini-movie
- philosophy-thoughts-feelings-desires
- philosophy-first-ask-last-ask

## How to Use

1. **Start with One Belief** - Articulate it before writing anything
2. **Run the Three Box Check** - If your idea fails, find a better angle
3. **Apply Croc Brain Filters** - Ensure every piece passes all three
4. **Adopt the Mindset** - Use the 13 Things and Domination frameworks

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for a categorized list of all frameworks with one-line descriptions.

## Evaldo's Core Philosophy

- **VSLs are mini-movies** - Entertainment that persuades, not ads that sell
- **One belief controls everything** - If they believe this one thing, they'll buy
- **Filter ruthlessly** - Ideas that fail the Three Box get rejected
- **Simple beats clever** - The croc brain is lazy; don't make it work
