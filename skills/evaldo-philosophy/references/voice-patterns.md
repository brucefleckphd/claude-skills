## THE EVALDO VOICE

### Core Principle
Evaldo's copy is clear, direct, and cinematic. It reads like a movie script, not a sales pitch. Every word earns its place.

### The Mini-Movie Mindset
- Write scenes, not paragraphs
- Show, don't tell (people doing things)
- Create character and conflict
- The prospect IS the hero

## EVALDO'S SIGNATURE PATTERNS

### The Curiosity Hook
Never reveal everything. Always leave something:
- "What happened next changed everything..."
- "But that's not even the important part..."
- "The real discovery came when..."

### The Pattern Interrupt
Break expectations:
- "Forget everything you've heard about..."
- "This isn't what you think..."
- "The opposite is true..."

### The Insider Reveal
Create exclusive feeling:
- "What they don't want you to know..."
- "Behind closed doors..."
- "The real story..."

## PHILOSOPHY VOICE CHECK

Before finalizing any copy section:

□ Does it sound like a movie or an ad?
□ Is the croc brain engaged (threat/opportunity)?
□ Is it simple enough for a 12-year-old?
□ Is there genuine curiosity created?
□ Does every sentence earn its place?
□ Would you keep watching/reading?
