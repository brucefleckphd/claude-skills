# Kern Pre-Webinar Funnel Frameworks

Complete framework set for everything BEFORE the webinar goes live—Kern's most unique contribution to webinar methodology.

**The Kern Difference:** While other experts focus on the webinar itself, Kern monetizes BEFORE you present, indoctrinates prospects with value BEFORE they attend, and systematically removes objections BEFORE you pitch.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Creating liquidator offers** - Monetize registrations immediately to offset ad costs
- **Building indoctrination sequences** - Pre-webinar video series that builds trust and removes skepticism
- **Market research (Recon)** - Three critical questions that drive everything
- **Maximizing show rates** - Email sequences and reminder strategies
- **Making webinars profitable before presenting** - Complete pre-webinar monetization system

**Core Philosophy:** "Make profit BEFORE the webinar. Remove objections BEFORE you pitch. Help them BEFORE you sell."

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## How to Use

### Phase 1: Recon (ALWAYS START HERE)
```
1. Use 2.1 Three Critical Recon Questions
   - What are their top 3 desires?
   - What are the 3 reasons WHY?
   - What are ALL reasons they won't buy? (Pick top 3)

2. Document answers thoroughly
   - Desires drive ad copy and registration page
   - Drivers inform video scripts and emotional appeals
   - Objections shape indoctrination content
```

**Kern's Warning:** "If you skip this, everything downstream is weakened."

### Phase 2: Liquidator Offer
```
1. Choose complementary product (2.13 Complement Rule)
   - Must NOT compete with webinar offer
   - Should solve prerequisite or adjacent problem

2. Create VSL (2.12 Six-Part VSL Structure)
   - Setup → Focus → Skepticism → Reveal → Tutorial → Offer
   - Price $47-$197 for impulse purchase

3. Position on thank-you page
   - Immediate monetization after registration
   - Goal: Offset 50-100% of traffic costs
```

### Phase 3: Indoctrination Sequence
```
1. Create Video 1 (2.5 WWWW Framework)
   - WHAT: What you'll cover on webinar
   - WHY #1: Why it's important
   - WHY #2: Why it's different from other webinars
   - WHEN: When to show up
   - 3-5 minutes max

2. Create Video 2 (2.2 Results in Advance)
   - Address primary area of skepticism
   - Actually HELP them (teach genuinely)
   - Demonstrate you CAN help by helping
   - 10-15 minutes max

3. Build Email Sequence (2.3)
   - Email 1: Confirmation + Video 1 link
   - Email 2: Video 2 + deeper value
```

### Phase 4: Reminder Emails
```
Use 2.4 Reminder Email Sequence (4-Email Day-Of Cadence)
   - 8am: "Today is the day"
   - 12pm: "Starting in X hours"
   - 2pm: "Starting in 1 hour"
   - 3pm: "Starting NOW"
```

## The Core Systems Explained

### System 1: LIQUIDATOR OFFER

**What it is:** A low-ticket complementary product offered immediately after registration.

**Purpose:**
- Monetize registrations instantly
- Offset traffic costs BEFORE webinar
- Potentially turn profit before you present

**The Math:**
```
1,000 registrants × $97 liquidator × 15% conversion = $14,550
If traffic cost $10/registrant = $10,000 spent
Result: $4,550 PROFIT before webinar even starts
```

**Critical Rules:**
1. Must COMPLEMENT webinar offer (never compete)
2. Price for impulse ($47-$197)
3. Deliver immediately (can't wait for webinar)
4. Use 6-part VSL structure

**Kern's Insight:** "I make my webinars profitable before they even occur."

---

### System 2: INDOCTRINATION SEQUENCE

**What it is:** Pre-webinar video series that builds trust, removes skepticism, and increases show rate.

**The Two Videos:**

**Video 1: WWWW (What, Why, Why, When)**
- WHAT: Topic/promise of webinar
- WHY #1: Why it's important (validate their problem)
- WHY #2: Why it's different (handle saturation skepticism)
- WHEN: When to show up + urgency
- **Length:** 3-5 minutes
- **Sent:** Immediately after registration

**Video 2: Results in Advance**
- Address primary skepticism/objection
- Actually TEACH them something valuable
- Overcome two angles of skepticism:
  1. Skepticism about YOUR ability to help
  2. Skepticism about THEIR ability to help themselves
- **Length:** 10-15 minutes
- **Sent:** 1-2 days before webinar

**Why This Works:**

> "We're going to demonstrate that you can help them by a novel concept here, actually helping them. And we simultaneously, through doing that, are going to help them help themselves by providing results in advance." - Frank Kern

**Psychological Principles:**
- **Familiarity Breeds Conversion** - More exposure = higher show rate + higher conversion
- **Robert Collier's Conversation Principle** - Enter the conversation already in their head
- **Pre-emptive Objection Handling** - Disable objections before you pitch

---

### System 3: RECON WORKSHEET

**The Three Critical Questions:**

**Question 1: What are their top 3 DESIRES?**
- What do they WANT? (The results)
- Surface-level tangible outcomes
- Example (webinar market): List/leads, Sales, Authority/positioning

**Question 2: What are the 3 reasons WHY?**
- WHY do they want those desires?
- Deeper emotional drivers
- Connect to Maslow's hierarchy
- Example: Certainty, Freedom, Contribution/significance

**Question 3: What are ALL reasons they would NOT buy?**
- Brainstorm EXHAUSTIVELY (10+ objections)
- Then identify the 3 BIGGEST
- Example: No list, Don't know how to sell, Tech confusion

**How These Drive Campaign:**

| Question | Drives... |
|----------|-----------|
| Desires (Q1) | Ad copy, registration page headlines, hooks |
| Drivers (Q2) | "So you can" statements, emotional appeals, testimonials |
| Objections (Q3) | Indoctrination content, webinar teaching, FAQ |

**Kern's Warning:** "Question 3 is where most of the money is because no one wants to address objections."

---

### System 4: BAG OF TRICKS

**What it is:** Situation-solution brainstorming worksheet for creating teaching content.

**How to Use:**
1. List all situations/problems prospects face
2. For each situation, brainstorm 6+ solutions
3. Cross-reference: Which situations does your webinar topic solve?
4. Convert solutions into "So if you" statements
5. Use these as bullet points in copy and teaching segments

**Example:**
- **Situation:** "No registrations for my webinar"
- **Solutions:** Better ad copy, better targeting, liquidator offer, JV partnerships, social proof, indoctrination sequence
- **"So if you" statement:** "So if you're getting traffic but no registrations, this framework will show you exactly where your leak is and how to patch it in under 2 hours."

**Purpose:** Generate unlimited content angles and teaching material from systematically connecting problems to solutions.

---

## Critical Principles

### Principle 1: Certainty is King
For webinar buyers specifically, the #1 emotional driver is CERTAINTY—systematic, predictable revenue, not one-time wins. Position your system as REPEATABLE and SYSTEMATIC.

**Language to use:** systematic, predictable, consistent, deployable, reliable, repeatable

### Principle 2: Two Types of Belief Problems

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't believe YOU | Proof, credentials, helping them in advance |
| Don't believe in THEMSELVES | Testimonials from people like them, simplified process, "If I can, you can" messaging |

### Principle 3: Familiarity Breeds Conversion
More pre-webinar exposure = higher show rate + higher webinar conversion. Don't fear "giving away too much"—the more you help before, the more they buy during.

### Principle 4: Complement, Never Compete
Liquidator must solve a DIFFERENT problem than webinar offer. If it competes, you cannibalize main sales. If it complements, you increase main sales.

### Principle 5: Results in Advance
The best way to overcome skepticism is not to argue or prove—it's to HELP THEM and let them experience results before you ask for the sale.

## The Complete Pre-Webinar Sequence

**Day -7 to -3: Registration Phase**
```
Traffic → Registration Page → Thank You Page + Liquidator VSL
                                ↓
                            Confirmation Email + Video 1 (WWWW)
                                ↓
                            Indoctrination Email 2 + Video 2 (Results in Advance)
```

**Day -1: Pre-Webinar Day**
```
Reminder Email: "Tomorrow is the day, here's what to expect"
```

**Day 0: Webinar Day**
```
8am:  "Today is the day"
12pm: "Starting in X hours"
2pm:  "Starting in 1 hour"
3pm:  "Starting NOW - join here"
```

**Result:**
- Registrations monetized via liquidator
- Skepticism removed via indoctrination
- Show rate maximized via reminders
- Objections pre-handled via teaching
- Trust built via helping in advance

**Kern's Bottom Line:** "If you just do the stuff from Module 1, you'll already have a registration process that can not only attract registrants, but can also liquidate them and offset the cost of your marketing, if not eliminate the cost of your marketing altogether, thus causing your webinars to be profitable before they even occur."

## The Six-Part VSL Structure (Deep Dive)

**Framework 2.12 - Complete Breakdown**

### Part 1: THE SETUP
**Purpose:** Position as tutorial, create active engagement

**Structure:**
1. Confirm successful registration
2. Position video as "tutorial" not "sales pitch"
3. Ask them to grab pen and paper
4. State what they'll learn (3-5 benefits)
5. Countdown: "5... 4... 3... 2... 1... let's begin"

**Why countdown?** Creates anticipation, signals start of "real" content, psychological engagement

**Duration:** 30-60 seconds max

---

### Part 2: FOCUS
**Purpose:** Control their mental focus on the outcome they want

**Structure:**
- "Imagine this scenario..."
- Series of result-oriented what-if questions
- Paint vivid mental picture of desired end state
- Make them picture THEMSELVES in that situation

**Examples:**
- "What if you could predictably generate $10K/month from webinars?"
- "Imagine knowing exactly what to say to overcome the 'I need to think about it' objection"
- "What if you never had to worry about show rates again?"

**Critical Rule:** Questions must be RESULT-oriented, not process-oriented
- Good: "What if you could double your show rate?"
- Bad: "What if you knew which emails to send?"

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Part 3: SKEPTICISM
**Purpose:** Acknowledge and diffuse their natural doubt

**Structure:**
1. "Sound like a stretch?"
2. "I know what you're thinking..."
3. Feel-Felt-Found story:
   - "I know how you FEEL"
   - "I FELT the same way"
   - "Here's what I FOUND"
4. Brief personal story of overcoming similar skepticism

**Why this works:** Acknowledges the elephant in the room, builds rapport through shared experience

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Part 4: THE REVEAL
**Purpose:** Reveal the discovery/insight that changed everything

**Structure:**
1. "Here's what I discovered..."
2. The specific insight, method, or realization
3. Must be 100% TRUTHFUL (no fake stories)
4. Should feel like a lightbulb moment

**Examples:**
- "I discovered that show rate matters 10x more than conversion rate"
- "I found that pre-webinar videos could double attendance"
- "I realized the liquidator offer completely changes the economics"

**Critical Rule:** Must be believable and genuine. Fake discoveries kill credibility.

**Duration:** 1-3 minutes

---

### Part 5: THE TUTORIAL
**Purpose:** Demonstrate you can help by ACTUALLY HELPING

**Structure:**
1. "Let me show you three things..."
2. Teach 3 major concepts/techniques
3. Each should be genuinely valuable (1-3 minutes per concept)
4. Provide real tactical value they can implement

**Kern's Philosophy:** "10-20% of people will buy even if you teach them everything."

**Why teach real content?**
- Proves you know what you're talking about
- Builds trust and goodwill
- Shows the depth of your knowledge
- Makes them realize they need more

**Common mistake:** Rushing through tutorial to get to offer faster. Don't.

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes (longest section)

---

### Part 6: THE OFFER
**Purpose:** Present the product and call to action

**Structure:**
1. **Transition:** "Here's what I've got for you..."
2. **Components:** Describe what's included
3. **Benefits:** "So you can..." for each component
4. **Price:** Clear, single price point
5. **Guarantee:** Risk reversal
6. **Deadline:** Scarcity/urgency
7. **CTA:** Clear next step ("Click the button below")

**Optional:** Add story at end to keep buy button visible longer

**Components description format:**
- "You'll get [Component 1] so you can [benefit]"
- "Plus [Component 2] which means [benefit]"
- "And [Component 3] that helps you [benefit]"

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

---

### VSL Timing Summary
```
Part 1: Setup          →  0:30
Part 2: Focus          →  1:30
Part 3: Skepticism     →  1:30
Part 4: Reveal         →  2:00
Part 5: Tutorial       → 10:00
Part 6: Offer          →  4:00
                         ------
Total:                  ~19:30
```

**Conversion benchmark:** 10-30% for liquidator offer ($47-$197 range)

---

## The WWWW Framework (Deep Dive)

**Framework 2.5 - Complete Breakdown**

### Component 1: WHAT
**Purpose:** State clearly what the webinar will cover

**Structure:**
- Clear promise or topic statement
- What they'll learn
- What problem it solves
- Frame as "training" or "class" not "pitch"

**Example:**
"We're going to cover how to create a webinar funnel that's profitable BEFORE you even present. I'll show you the three components that make this possible and exactly how to implement each one."

**Duration:** 20-30 seconds

---

### Component 2: WHY #1 (IMPORTANCE)
**Purpose:** Validate why this matters, tap emotional drivers

**Structure:**
- Why this problem is critical to solve NOW
- What happens if they don't solve it (pain)
- What's possible when they do solve it (pleasure)
- Use third-party validation if possible

**Techniques:**
- **Third-Party Validation:** "According to research..." or "Industry studies show..."
- **Spoken Bullet Points:** Rapid-fire list of reasons why this matters
- **Emotional Drivers:** Connect to Question 2 from Recon (certainty, freedom, etc.)

**Example:**
"This matters because right now you're on the hamster wheel—spending money on traffic, hoping people show up, praying they buy. Without a systematic approach, you're gambling every time. But when you have a proven system, you get CERTAINTY. You know that when you deploy a webinar, you'll hit your revenue target within reason."

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Component 3: WHY #2 (DIFFERENTIATION)
**Purpose:** Address skepticism about how this is different

**Structure:**
- How this webinar is different from others
- What makes your approach unique
- Why they should pay attention despite saturation

**When to lead with this:** In saturated markets where skepticism is high

**Example:**
"This webinar is dramatically different from others you might have attended because it's literally designed to be like a miniature condensed masterclass. I'm not going to pitch you for 90 minutes. I'm going to TEACH you the system, show you the worksheets, and walk you through the process. Then at the end, if you want help implementing, I'll make an offer. But you could take what I teach and do it yourself."

**Techniques:**
- **Positioning:** "This is a class, not a pitch"
- **Pre-emptive Objection Handling:** "I know you've been burned by webinars before..."
- **Non-douchey Factor:** "I'm not going to hype you"
- **Framework Statement:** "This is a proven system, not theory"

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Component 4: WHEN (EVERGREEN METHOD)
**Purpose:** Create urgency for attending, handle "I'll watch the replay" objection

**Structure:**
- When the webinar is (date/time)
- Why NOW is the perfect time
- No replay language (if applicable)
- Urgency factors (limited spots, one-time only, etc.)

**Evergreen approach:**
"Right now is actually the perfect time because [reason related to season/market/their situation]"

**Examples:**
- "Right now at the beginning of the year when people are setting goals"
- "Right now before Q4 when ad costs spike"
- "Right now while this strategy still works before everyone does it"

**No Replay Language:**
"There won't be a recorded replay of this, so you need to attend live to get this."

**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

---

### Blending the Four Components

**Critical Insight:** Don't present WWWW as rigid checklist. Blend them naturally.

**Example of Natural Blending:**
```
[WHAT + WHY #2 combined]
"Hey everyone, thanks for registering. On this webinar we're going to
cover how to make your webinars profitable BEFORE you present. Now,
this is VERY different from other webinars you've attended because..."

[WHY #1 with social proof]
"And this matters because according to recent data, 80% of webinar
marketers lose money on their first few campaigns. They're on the
hamster wheel, constantly reinventing..."

[WHY #2 continued]
"So what makes this approach different? Three things: First..."

[WHEN with evergreen framing]
"We're going to cover this on [date] at [time], and right now is
actually the perfect time because..."
```

**Lead with audience's biggest concern:**
- Skeptical, saturated audience? Lead with WHY #2
- New to topic audience? Lead with WHAT and WHY #1
- Urgent problem audience? Lead with WHY #1

---

### Key Techniques for WWWW

**"So If You" Language Pattern:**
Connects situation to benefit

**Structure:** "So if you [situation], [result/benefit]"

**Examples:**
- "So if you're spending $5K on traffic and only making $3K back, this will show you how to flip that"
- "So if you've got a great webinar but nobody shows up, this will fix your show rate problem"
- "So if you're tired of the launch hamster wheel, this gives you a systematic approach"

**Minimum:** Use 5+ "So if you" statements in Video 1

---

**Framework Statement:**
Qualifies your audience and establishes authority

**Example:**
"Now this framework works best for people who already have an audience or can drive traffic. If you're brand new and have zero following, you'll want to build that first. But if you have even a small list or can buy traffic, this will transform your results."

---

**Prospects Don't Care About You Principle:**
Frame everything around THEIR results, not your credentials

**Bad:** "I've done 500 webinars and made $10M"
**Good:** "You'll be able to deploy a webinar that generates predictable revenue"

**When to mention credentials:** Only to establish credibility for a specific claim
**How to mention:** Brief and in service of their outcome

---

## Email Sequence Architecture

### Email 1: Liquidator + Confirmation
**Sent:** Immediately after registration

**Structure:**
1. **Subject:** "Your [Webinar Name] login details"
2. **Preview text:** "Plus a quick bonus for registering..."
3. **Body:**
   - Confirm registration (above fold)
   - Webinar date/time/login (above fold)
   - Transition: "One more thing..."
   - Liquidator offer (VSL embed or link)
   - Brief explanation of how liquidator complements webinar
4. **P.S.:** Address skepticism about liquidator

**Triple-Click Opportunity Above Fold:**
Every link/button above fold should go to same destination (webinar registration confirmation or calendar add)

---

### Email 2: Video 1 (WWWW)
**Sent:** Day after registration or 2 days before webinar

**Structure:**
1. **Subject:** "FNAME, your pre-webinar training is ready"
2. **Preview text:** "What to expect on [date]..."
3. **Body:**
   - "Thank you for registering for [webinar]"
   - "I put together a short video that explains what we'll cover"
   - Link to Video 1
   - Brief bullets of what they'll learn
   - Reminder of webinar date/time
4. **P.S.:** Scarcity or urgency element

---

### Email 3: Video 2 (Results in Advance)
**Sent:** Day before webinar

**Structure:**
1. **Subject:** "FNAME, I got a question about [objection]"
2. **Preview text:** "Here's how to handle it..."
3. **Body:**
   - "A lot of people have been asking about [major objection]"
   - "I recorded a video to answer this because it's so important"
   - Link to Video 2
   - "This will help you [benefit] even before the webinar"
   - Reminder: "See you tomorrow at [time]"
4. **P.S.:** "No recorded replay, so make sure you attend live"

**Timing note:** Must be sent day BEFORE, not day OF. Gives them time to watch and process.

---

### Emails 4-7: Day-Of Reminder Cadence
**Sent:** Day of webinar

**Email 4 (5am):** "FNAME, our meeting today"
**Email 5 (2 hours before):** "Login Info for FNAME (for the webinar)"
**Email 6 (30 min before):** "FNAME, we're on in 30 minutes"
**Email 7 (at start):** "FNAME, your class is starting now"

**Each must include:**
- Webinar login credentials (above fold)
- Time of webinar
- "No recorded replay" language
- Clear CTA to join

**Why 4 emails?** "They won't write it down. At webinar time, they'll search their email for the link. If they don't see one immediately, they'll give up."

---

## The Economics: Why This Works

### Traditional Webinar Math
```
Traffic Cost:        $5,000 (1,000 registrants at $5 each)
Show Rate:           25% (250 attendees)
Conversion:          10% (25 buyers)
Product Price:       $1,000
Revenue:             $25,000
Profit:              $20,000
ROI:                 400%
```

### Kern Liquidator Math
```
Traffic Cost:        $5,000 (1,000 registrants at $5 each)
Liquidator Sales:    $14,550 (150 buyers at $97, 15% conversion)
Show Rate:           50% (500 attendees - doubled with indoctrination)
Conversion:          10% (50 buyers)
Product Price:       $1,000
Webinar Revenue:     $50,000
Total Revenue:       $64,550
Profit:              $59,550
ROI:                 1,191%
```

**Improvements:**
- 3x total profit ($59,550 vs $20,000)
- Nearly 3x ROI (1,191% vs 400%)
- Traffic costs offset by liquidator
- Can afford higher CPA than competitors
- Webinar revenue is nearly pure profit

**The Compounding Effect:**
Because you can afford higher CPA, you can:
- Outbid competitors for traffic
- Scale faster
- Test more aggressively
- Build larger lists

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Recon
**Problem:** Creating content without deeply understanding market

**Fix:** Complete Three Critical Recon Questions FIRST

**Validation:** Can you write compelling bullets instantly? If not, dig deeper.

---

### Mistake 2: Competing Liquidator
**Problem:** Liquidator solves same problem as webinar, cannibalizing sales

**Fix:** Liquidator must solve prerequisite, adjacent, or complementary problem

**Test:** Are liquidator buyers MORE likely to buy main offer? Should be yes.

---

### Mistake 3: Pitching in Indoctrination
**Problem:** Video 2 sells instead of teaches

**Fix:** 90% teaching, 0% pitching. Teaching IS the selling.

---

### Mistake 4: Too Long
**Problem:** Videos exceed attention span

**Fix:**
- Video 1: 3-5 minutes max
- Video 2: 10-15 minutes max

---

### Mistake 5: Missing Belief Problems
**Problem:** Only address "Do they believe me?" miss "Do they believe in themselves?"

**Fix:** Include testimonials from people like them, simplify process, "If I can, you can" messaging

---

### Mistake 6: Weak Tutorial in VSL
**Problem:** Rushing Part 5 to pitch faster

**Fix:** Actually teach 3 substantial things. Tutorial proves you can help.

---

### Mistake 7: Leading with Credentials
**Problem:** "I've done 500 webinars..." when audience doesn't care

**Fix:** Lead with THEIR skepticism/problem. Frame everything around their results.

## The Bottom Line

Kern's pre-webinar funnel is his **most unique contribution**:

1. **Liquidator offers** → Profit before presenting
2. **Indoctrination sequences** → Double show rates
3. **Recon questions** → Market-driven everything

**Traditional approach:** Focus on presentation
**Kern's approach:** Focus on preparation

**The result:** Higher show rates, warmer audiences, pre-handled objections, webinars profitable before you present.

**Start here:**
1. Complete recon (Three Critical Questions)
2. Build liquidator (Six-Part VSL)
3. Create indoctrination (WWWW + Results in Advance)
4. Program emails (7-email sequence)
5. THEN worry about the webinar itself

**Kern's philosophy:** "The money is in the preparation, not the presentation."
