## Tier 1: King/Queen Frameworks

The 5 strategic foundations that make everything else work.

### 2.1. Three Critical Recon Questions
**Use when:** Beginning any webinar campaign, before creating any copy or content

**Pattern:**
Before creating anything, answer three questions about your marketplace:
1. What are their top 3 desires? (What they want - the results)
2. What are the 3 reasons WHY? (The emotional drivers behind those desires)
3. What are ALL the reasons they would NOT buy? (Every objection - brainstorm exhaustively, then pick the 3 BIGGEST)

These answers drive everything: webinar content, ad copy, registration pages, liquidator offer, and ultimately revenue.

**Kern's Warning:** "If you skip this, everything downstream is weakened."

---

### 2.2. Liquidator Offer Strategy
**Use when:** Monetizing registrations immediately, offsetting traffic costs, turning profit before webinar even begins

**Pattern:**
Immediately after registration, present a low-ticket offer (liquidator) that helps offset traffic costs or turn profit BEFORE the webinar. This allows you to spend more on traffic acquisition because you're getting paid back immediately.

**Critical Rules:**
- Price for impulse purchase ($47-$197 range)
- Must complement (not compete with) what you're selling on the webinar
- Should solve a related but different problem

**The Math:** 1,000 registrants × $97 liquidator × 15% conversion = $14,550 revenue before webinar starts

---

### 2.2. Indoctrination Video 2: Results in Advance
**Use when:** Creating the second pre-webinar indoctrination video to overcome skepticism and build goodwill

**Pattern:**
Address skepticism by actually helping them achieve results before the webinar. Identify their primary area of concern or skepticism, then create a teaching video that genuinely helps them overcome that problem.

**Why it works:** Disables skepticism about your ability to help them AND their ability to help themselves by providing results in advance.

**Structure:**
1. Thank them for registering, frame as answer to question you're getting
2. State the big objection as a question
3. Teach 6+ genuinely helpful ideas (1-2 minutes each)
4. Use "So if you" pattern throughout
5. Optional: Tell supporting story
6. Close with webinar reminder and benefits

**Length:** 10-15 minutes max

---

### 2.12. Six-Part VSL Structure (Liquidator Offer)
**Use when:** Creating liquidator offer video sales letter, any immediate post-opt-in pitch, low-ticket VSL

**Pattern:**
1. **SETUP** - Position as tutorial, ask for pen/paper, state what they'll learn, countdown 5-4-3-2-1
2. **FOCUS** - "Imagine this scenario..." + result-oriented what-if questions, paint mental picture
3. **SKEPTICISM** - "Sound like a stretch?" + feel-felt-found story to address doubt
4. **REVEAL** - Reveal the 'discovery' that helped you (be 100% truthful)
5. **TUTORIAL** - Actually teach 3 major things to demonstrate you can help by helping
6. **OFFER** - What I got + what it'll do + what I want you to do next, components/benefits with "so you can", price, CTA, guarantee, deadline

**Can add:** Story at end to keep buy button visible longer

**Timing:** ~19 minutes total (Setup 0:30, Focus 1:30, Skepticism 1:30, Reveal 2:00, Tutorial 10:00, Offer 4:00)

**Conversion benchmark:** 10-30% for liquidator offer ($47-$197 range)

---

### 2.13. Liquidator Offer Complement Rule
**Use when:** Choosing what to sell as liquidator offer, ensuring liquidator doesn't cannibalize main webinar sale

**Pattern:**
Liquidator offer MUST complement the thing you're selling on webinar, NOT compete with it.

**Complementary means:**
- Solves a related but different problem
- Solves a prerequisite problem
- Solves an adjacent problem

**Examples:**
- Webinar sells email marketing course → Liquidator sells list-building tactics (prerequisite)
- Webinar sells consulting system → Liquidator sells video creation training (complementary tool)
- Kern uses Video Black Box as liquidator for various webinars because video complements everything

**Test:** Are liquidator buyers MORE likely to buy main offer? Should be yes. If no, repositioning needed.

---

## Tier 2: Jack Frameworks

24 critical supporting systems and principles.

### Recon & Psychology (4 frameworks)

#### 2.10. Belief in You vs Belief in Themselves
**Use when:** Understanding objections, crafting testimonials, addressing confidence issues

**Pattern:**
Two types of belief problems:
1. They don't believe YOU - solved with proof, credibility, helping them in advance
2. They don't believe in THEMSELVES - "I believe it worked for you, but you must have special powers because that could never work for me"

The second is often MORE powerful than the first and requires different handling.

**Solutions for self-belief:**
- Show people like them succeeding
- Remove perceived special requirements
- Simplify the process
- Acknowledge their doubt while showing it's unfounded

---

#### 2.11. Certainty as Primary Webinar Driver
**Use when:** Understanding what drives webinar buyers, crafting core promise, positioning your system

**Pattern:**
For webinar market specifically, the #1 emotional driver is CERTAINTY - knowing they will hit a certain revenue stream or range with consistency.

**What they really want:**
- Systematic way to predictably deliver sales and revenue
- Predictably generate leads
- NOT just "a way that works" but a way that works PREDICTABLY and SYSTEMATICALLY

**Language to use:** systematic, predictable, consistent, deployable, reliable, repeatable

**Kern's Insight:** This is more valuable than higher revenue without certainty. They'd rather have $10K/month predictably than a shot at $100K one time.

---

#### 2.8. Kern's Three Emotional Drivers Example
**Use when:** Understanding WHY prospects want what they want, connecting features to emotional benefits

**Pattern:**
The deeper emotional drivers (reasons WHY) behind webinar market desires are:
1. **Certainty** - Predictable revenue, knowing a deployed webinar will generate X dollars within reason, getting off the hamster wheel
2. **Freedom** - Freedom to do what they want, freedom FROM things they don't want, financial freedom
3. **Contribution and significance** - Being seen as leader, helping others, mattering

These align with Maslow's hierarchy of human needs.

**How to use:** Connect WHAT they want to WHY they want it using "so you can" transition.

---

#### 2.9. Kern's Objections List Example
**Use when:** Identifying all reasons prospects won't buy, prioritizing which objections to address

**Pattern:**
Comprehensive objection brainstorm for webinar market:
- Tech confusion
- Lack of confidence in self
- Fear of speaking
- No list
- Tried before/failed
- Don't know how to sell
- No traffic
- Negative beliefs about selling
- Webinar=hype
- Seen it before (not new)
- Don't know what to sell
- Webinars are 'dead'
- Don't believe YOU

From this exhaustive list, identify the 3 BIGGEST: (1) No list, (2) Don't know how to sell/negative beliefs about selling, (3) Tech confusion

**These 3 must be addressed on webinar BEFORE asking for sale.**

---

### WWWW Indoctrination System (12 frameworks)

#### 2.5. WWWW Framework (What, Why, Why, When)
**Use when:** Creating indoctrination Video 1, explaining webinar value before they attend

**Pattern:**
Four components to blend naturally (not rigidly):
- **WHAT** - What you'll cover on webinar (clear promise)
- **WHY #1 (Importance)** - Why this matters (tap emotional drivers)
- **WHY #2 (Differentiation)** - How this is different (address skepticism)
- **WHEN** - When this applies (evergreen: "right now is perfect time")

**Lead with audience's biggest concern:**
- Skeptical, saturated audience? Lead with WHY #2
- New to topic audience? Lead with WHAT and WHY #1
- Urgent problem audience? Lead with WHY #1

**Length:** 3-5 minutes max

---

#### 2.5. Video 1 - WHAT Component Structure
**Use when:** Opening indoctrination Video 1, stating clear webinar promise

**Pattern:**
- Clear promise or topic statement
- What they'll learn
- What problem it solves
- Frame as "training" or "class" not "pitch"

**Example:** "We're going to cover how to create a webinar funnel that's profitable BEFORE you even present. I'll show you the three components that make this possible and exactly how to implement each one."

**Duration:** 20-30 seconds

---

#### 2.5. Video 1 - WHY #1 (Importance) Component
**Use when:** Validating why topic matters, tapping emotional drivers

**Pattern:**
- Why this problem is critical to solve NOW
- What happens if they don't solve it (pain)
- What's possible when they do solve it (pleasure)
- Use third-party validation if possible

**Techniques:**
- Third-Party Validation: "According to research..." or "Industry studies show..."
- Spoken Bullet Points: Rapid-fire list of reasons why this matters
- Emotional Drivers: Connect to Question 2 from Recon (certainty, freedom, etc.)

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

#### 2.5. Video 1 - WHY #2 (Differentiation) Component
**Use when:** Addressing skepticism about how this is different, saturated markets

**Pattern:**
- How this webinar is different from others
- What makes your approach unique
- Why they should pay attention despite saturation

**Techniques:**
- Positioning: "This is a class, not a pitch"
- Pre-emptive Objection Handling: "I know you've been burned by webinars before..."
- Non-douchey Factor: "I'm not going to hype you"
- Framework Statement: "This is a proven system, not theory"

**When to lead with this:** In saturated markets where skepticism is high

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

---

#### 2.5. Video 1 - WHEN Component (Evergreen Method)
**Use when:** Creating urgency for attending, handling "I'll watch the replay" objection

**Pattern:**
- When the webinar is (date/time)
- Why NOW is the perfect time
- No replay language (if applicable)
- Urgency factors (limited spots, one-time only, etc.)

**Evergreen approach:** "Right now is actually the perfect time because [reason related to season/market/their situation]"

**Examples:**
- "Right now at the beginning of the year when people are setting goals"
- "Right now before Q4 when ad costs spike"
- "Right now while this strategy still works before everyone does it"

**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

---

#### 2.5. Robert Collier's Conversation Principle
**Use when:** Opening any video, email, or webinar

**Pattern:**
"Enter the conversation already happening in the prospect's mind"

Don't start with YOUR agenda. Start with THEIR internal dialogue.

**Examples:**
- Bad: "Hi, I'm Frank and I've done 500 webinars..."
- Good: "You've probably noticed that most webinars are 90-minute pitches disguised as training..."

**Why it works:** Instantly creates rapport because you're voicing what they're already thinking.

---

#### 2.5. "So If You" Language Pattern
**Use when:** Throughout all videos, emails, and copy to connect situations to benefits

**Structure:** "So if you [situation], [result/benefit]"

**Examples:**
- "So if you're spending $5K on traffic and only making $3K back, this will show you how to flip that"
- "So if you've got a great webinar but nobody shows up, this will fix your show rate problem"
- "So if you're tired of the launch hamster wheel, this gives you a systematic approach"

**Minimum:** Use 5+ "So if you" statements in Video 1

**Purpose:** Bridges objections/situations to benefits, makes it immediately relevant

---

#### 2.5. Prospects Don't Care About You Principle
**Use when:** Any time you're tempted to lead with credentials or personal achievements

**Pattern:**
Frame everything around THEIR results, not your credentials.

**Bad:** "I've done 500 webinars and made $10M"
**Good:** "You'll be able to deploy a webinar that generates predictable revenue"

**When to mention credentials:** Only to establish credibility for a specific claim
**How to mention:** Brief and in service of their outcome

---

#### 2.5. Framework Statement for Qualification
**Use when:** Qualifying your audience and establishing authority

**Pattern:**
State who this is for and who it's not for.

**Example:** "Now this framework works best for people who already have an audience or can drive traffic. If you're brand new and have zero following, you'll want to build that first. But if you have even a small list or can buy traffic, this will transform your results."

**Why it works:** Filters audience, increases perceived value, establishes authority through specificity

---

#### 2.5. Lead With Skepticism in Saturated Markets
**Use when:** Your audience is burned out on webinars/your topic

**Pattern:**
In saturated markets, lead with WHY #2 (differentiation) instead of WHAT or WHY #1.

**Kern's example opening:** "This webinar is dramatically different from others you might have attended because it's literally designed to be like a miniature condensed masterclass..."

**Why:** Skepticism is their PRIMARY mental state. Address it FIRST or they tune out.

---

#### 2.5. 3-Minute Indoctrination Video Sweet Spot
**Use when:** Creating Video 1 (WWWW)

**Pattern:**
Target 3-5 minutes max. Kern's actual Video 1 was 3:22.

**Why:** Long enough to cover all WWWW components, short enough to maintain attention and completion rate.

**If video runs long:** Cut examples, not components. All four WWWW components must be present.

---

#### 2.5. Blended Bullet Points (Importance + Differentiation)
**Use when:** Creating spoken bullet points in videos

**Pattern:**
Don't separate WHY #1 and WHY #2 rigidly. Blend them in single bullet points.

**Example:** "You'll learn how to systematically generate leads [importance] using a method that doesn't require sleazy tactics [differentiation]"

**Why it works:** More natural flow, addresses multiple psychological triggers simultaneously

---

### Email & Reminder Systems (8 frameworks)

#### 2.3. Indoctrination Sequence Purpose
**Use when:** Between registration and webinar

**Pattern:**
The indoctrination sequence is a series of videos designed to:
1. Resell them on the idea of attending the webinar
2. Provide results in advance for them
3. Build goodwill
4. Build more credibility for you
5. Build more familiarity
6. Build more trust

**Result:** Makes people actually show up. Without it, you get high registration but low attendance.

**Kern's Principle:** "Familiarity breeds conversion"

---

#### 2.3. Indoctrination Email 1 Structure
**Use when:** Sending the first indoctrination video to registrants (usually next day after opt-in)

**Pattern:**
- **Subject:** "for [FNAME], new video from [You]"
- **Opening line:** "I just shot this brand new video for you" (appears in preview text)
- **Above fold:** Clickable image from video
- **Include:** Duration and topic
- **Triple-click opportunity:** 2-3 clickable elements before scrolling
- **P.S.:** Restate webinar benefits and address skepticism
- **P.P.S.:** Preview next video coming

---

#### 2.3. Indoctrination Email 2 Structure
**Use when:** Sending Video 2 (Results in Advance), day before webinar

**Pattern:**
- **Subject:** "FNAME, I got a question about [objection]"
- **Opening:** "A lot of people have been asking about [major objection]"
- **Body:** Link to Video 2, explain it will help them even before webinar
- **P.S.:** "See you tomorrow at [time]" + "No recorded replay, attend live"

**Timing:** Must be sent day BEFORE, not day OF. Gives them time to watch and process.

---

#### 2.3. Liquidator Email Template
**Use when:** Immediately after webinar registration

**Pattern:**
1. **Subject:** "NAME, before you attend, watch this"
2. Brief thanks for registering
3. Link to pitch page (liquidator) disguised as tutorial
4. List 3-5 benefits of the tutorial
5. Social proof about how you use the thing you're selling
6. Second link to pitch page
7. **P.S.:** Webinar date, time, timezone, join instructions

---

#### 2.3. Email Preview Text Strategy
**Use when:** Crafting the opening line of any email

**Pattern:**
The first ~60 characters of your email appear as preview text in most email clients. This preview text is visible BEFORE they open.

**Strategy:** State what the email contains and who it's for in the first sentence.

**Example:** "I just shot this brand new video for you"

---

#### 2.3. Triple-Click Opportunity Above Fold
**Use when:** Designing emails with links/buttons

**Pattern:**
Every link/button above the fold should go to same destination.

**Why:** Give them multiple opportunities to click without scrolling. Increases click-through rate.

**Example:** In confirmation email, have 3 different clickable elements all going to webinar registration confirmation or calendar add.

---

#### 2.3. Addressing Skepticism in P.S.
**Use when:** Closing any promotional email

**Pattern:**
Use P.S. to pre-emptively address major objection or skepticism.

**Examples:**
- "P.S. This isn't another 90-minute pitch. It's actual training."
- "P.S. No credit card required to register."
- "P.S. There won't be a recorded replay, so attend live."

**Why it works:** P.S. is one of most-read parts of email. Use it strategically.

---

#### 2.3. Indoctrination Email 2 Timing
**Use when:** Scheduling Video 2 email

**Pattern:**
Send the day BEFORE webinar, not day OF.

**Why:** Gives them time to:
- Watch the video
- Process the content
- Experience the "results in advance"
- Build even more desire to attend

**Don't:** Send day-of. They won't have time to watch before webinar starts.

---

### Reminder & Technical Systems (6 frameworks)

#### 2.4. Reminder Email Sequence (4-Email Day-Of Cadence)
**Use when:** Day of webinar to maximize attendance

**Pattern:**
- **Email 1 (5am):** "FNAME, our meeting today"
- **Email 2 (2 hours before):** "Login Info for FNAME (for the webinar)"
- **Email 3 (30 min before):** "FNAME, we're on in 30 minutes"
- **Email 4 (at start):** "FNAME, your class is starting now"

**Each must include:**
- Webinar login credentials (above fold)
- Time of webinar
- "No recorded replay" language
- Clear CTA to join

**Why 4 emails?** "They won't write it down. At webinar time, they'll search their email for the link. If they don't see one immediately, they'll give up."

---

#### 2.4. No Recorded Replay Strategy
**Use when:** Driving live attendance

**Pattern:**
Tell them repeatedly there will be NO recorded replay available.

**Where to mention:**
- Thank you page
- Confirmation email
- Video 2 email
- All day-of reminder emails

**Why it works:** Creates urgency to attend live. Removes "I'll just watch the replay later" excuse.

**Alternative:** If offering replay, make it expire quickly (24-48 hours) and mention that deadline.

---

#### 2.4. Bag of Tricks Worksheet System
**Use when:** Creating teaching content, generating bullet points, connecting problems to solutions

**Pattern:**
1. List all situations/problems prospects face
2. For each situation, brainstorm 6+ solutions
3. Cross-reference: Which situations does your webinar topic solve?
4. Convert solutions into "So if you" statements
5. Use these as bullet points in copy and teaching segments

**Example:**
- **Situation:** "No registrations for my webinar"
- **Solutions:** Better ad copy, better targeting, liquidator offer, JV partnerships, social proof, indoctrination sequence
- **"So if you" statement:** "So if you're getting traffic but no registrations, this framework will show you exactly where your leak is and how to patch it in under 2 hours."

**Purpose:** Generate unlimited content angles and teaching material from systematically connecting problems to solutions.

---

#### 2.4. Above-the-Fold Credentials Placement
**Use when:** Designing webinar registration pages or reminder emails

**Pattern:**
Webinar credentials (URL, ID, password, time) must be visible WITHOUT scrolling.

**Why:** People scan emails quickly. If they have to scroll to find login info, many won't bother.

**Implementation:** Put credentials at TOP of every day-of reminder email.

---

#### 2.4. GoToWebinar Stability Preference
**Use when:** Choosing webinar platform

**Pattern:**
Kern prefers GoToWebinar for stability and reliability over features.

**Why:** Other platforms may have more features, but GoToWebinar rarely crashes or has technical issues during live events.

**Trade-off:** Fewer bells and whistles, but rock-solid reliability matters more than features for high-stakes webinars.

---

#### 2.4. GoToWebinar Backdoor Integration Method
**Use when:** Integrating GoToWebinar with email service that doesn't have direct integration

**Pattern:**
Even if your email service doesn't officially integrate with GoToWebinar, you can still automate registration:

1. Create registration form in your email service (AWeber, Infusionsoft, etc.)
2. Set thank you page URL to your liquidator pitch page
3. Use email service's autoresponder to send webinar credentials
4. Manually upload registrant list to GoToWebinar before event

**Why:** Gives you control over registration process and immediate liquidator offer presentation.

---

## Tier 3: Supporting Frameworks

45 tactical implementations and templates.

### Video Creation & Delivery (15 frameworks)

#### 2.5. Indoctrination Video 1 Real-World Example Dissection
**Use when:** Learning how to blend WWWW components naturally

**Pattern:**
Kern's actual Video 1 for $890,000 advanced consulting webinar:
- Opens with WHAT + immediate segue to WHY #2 (differentiation) in first 36 seconds
- Then shifts to WHAT (misconceptions) + WHY #1 (importance) backed by third-party data
- Then deepens WHY #2 (how it's different) + pre-emptive objection handling
- Then spoken bullet points for WHY #1 (importance) + another objection handler ('non-douchey')
- Total runtime: 3:22

**Key insight:** Components blend fluidly rather than being rigidly separated.

---

#### 2.5. Natural Eloquence Through Practice
**Use when:** Recording videos, overcoming perfectionism

**Pattern:**
Kern's natural-sounding delivery comes from practice, not scripting.

**Method:**
1. Know your bullet points
2. Record it
3. Watch it back
4. Note awkward parts
5. Record again
6. Repeat until natural

**Don't:** Write and read scripts. Sounds stilted.
**Do:** Know your points, then talk naturally about them.

---

#### 2.5. Pre-emptive Objection Handling in Indoctrination
**Use when:** Creating Video 1 (WWWW)

**Pattern:**
Address objections BEFORE they fully form in prospect's mind.

**Example:** "I know you've been burned by webinars before. So have I. This is different because I'm actually going to teach you the system, not just hype you for 90 minutes."

**Why it works:** Defuses skepticism before it hardens into resistance.

---

#### 2.5. Spoken Bullet Points Technique
**Use when:** Listing multiple benefits or reasons

**Pattern:**
Rapid-fire spoken list without extensive elaboration on each point.

**Example:** "This matters because: one, you're losing money on traffic; two, your show rates are probably under 30%; three, you're on the hamster wheel of constant launches; four, you don't have a systematic approach; and five, your competitors are outspending you because they have liquidators."

**Why it works:** Packs multiple reasons into short time, maintains energy, prevents boring elaboration.

---

#### 2.5. Third-Party Validation Technique
**Use when:** Establishing importance or credibility

**Pattern:**
Reference external sources rather than just your opinion.

**Examples:**
- "According to research from XYZ..."
- "Industry studies show..."
- "Data from 10,000 webinars reveals..."

**Why it works:** Third-party validation is more credible than self-promotion.

---

#### 2.5. Introduction Formula for Video Opening
**Use when:** Opening any indoctrination video

**Pattern:**
1. Thank them for action they took (registering, watching, etc.)
2. State what this video is about
3. Enter conversation in their mind

**Example:** "Thanks for registering. I wanted to shoot this quick video to explain what we'll cover on the webinar and why this is different from other webinars you might have attended..."

**Duration:** 10-15 seconds

---

#### 2.5. How-To-X-Without-Y Formula
**Use when:** Crafting webinar titles or promises

**Pattern:**
"How to [desired outcome] without [major objection/fear]"

**Examples:**
- "How to make webinars profitable without complicated funnels"
- "How to get high show rates without expensive traffic"
- "How to sell on webinars without being pushy"

**Why it works:** Promises outcome while addressing major objection simultaneously.

---

#### 2.5. How-I-Did-X Formula
**Use when:** Crafting webinar titles or opening stories

**Pattern:**
"How I [achieved specific result] [timeframe/circumstances]"

**Examples:**
- "How I made $890,000 from a single webinar"
- "How I doubled my show rate in 30 days"
- "How I turned webinars profitable before presenting"

**Why it works:** Specific result + proof element + curiosity.

---

#### 2.5. Moving Towards vs Moving Away Language Patterns
**Use when:** Creating "So if you" statements

**Pattern:**
People are motivated by:
- **Moving TOWARDS** pleasure/gain (positive "So if you")
- **Moving AWAY FROM** pain/loss (negative "So if you")

**Examples:**
- Towards: "So if you want to scale to $100K/month, this shows you how"
- Away: "So if you're tired of wasting money on traffic that doesn't convert, this fixes it"

**Strategy:** Use BOTH throughout content. Different people respond to different triggers.

---

#### 2.5. Situation-to-So-If-You Conversion
**Use when:** Converting Bag of Tricks situations into compelling copy

**Pattern:**
1. Identify painful situation from Bag of Tricks
2. Connect to solution your content provides
3. Frame as "So if you [situation], [your solution provides result]"

**Example:**
- Situation: "Getting traffic but no registrations"
- Solution: "Registration page optimization"
- So if you: "So if you're getting clicks but no registrations, this framework shows you exactly where your leak is"

---

#### 2.5. Why-Different Section Construction
**Use when:** Building WHY #2 (Differentiation) component

**Pattern:**
State 3-5 ways your approach differs from typical approaches.

**Framework:**
"This is different because:
1. [Difference #1]
2. [Difference #2]
3. [Difference #3]"

**Example:**
"This webinar is different because:
1. I teach the system, not just hype you
2. You get worksheets, not just concepts
3. This is about BEFORE the webinar, not just during it"

---

#### 2.5. When-Component Evergreen Placement
**Use when:** Creating urgency without specific date/deadline

**Pattern:**
"Right now is the perfect time because [seasonal/market/situational reason]"

**Examples:**
- "Right now at the beginning of Q1 when people are setting goals"
- "Right now before ad costs spike in Q4"
- "Right now while this tactic still works before saturation"

**Why it works:** Creates urgency without requiring specific deadline. Can be reused with different seasonal angles.

---

#### 2.5. Lazy Bastards Motivation Technique
**Use when:** Addressing procrastination or overwhelm

**Pattern:**
Frame action as easier than inaction.

**Example:** "Look, I know you're busy. That's exactly WHY you need this. The two minutes you spend on this worksheet will save you 20 hours of guessing."

**Kern's philosophy:** Make it easier to take action than to avoid it.

---

#### 2.5. Short Video Emphasis for Completion
**Use when:** Creating any indoctrination video

**Pattern:**
Explicitly state video duration early: "This is just 3 minutes" or "Quick 10-minute video"

**Why:** Reduces perceived commitment, increases completion rate.

**Where to mention:** Subject line, preview text, first 10 seconds of video.

---

#### 2.5. Homework Urgency and Profitability Connection
**Use when:** Closing indoctrination videos with action steps

**Pattern:**
Connect the homework/worksheet to profit, not just learning.

**Example:** "Fill this out BEFORE the webinar because the people who do this homework make 3x more than those who don't. This is literally the difference between profit and loss."

**Why it works:** Urgency + profit motive + social proof (those who do vs those who don't).

---

### Worksheets & Planning (10 frameworks)

#### 2.5. Two-Minute Worksheet Philosophy
**Use when:** Creating planning worksheets

**Pattern:**
Keep worksheets simple enough to complete in 2 minutes (though results may take longer to implement).

**Why:** Reduces resistance to starting. "Just 2 minutes" feels doable.

**Implementation:** Clear questions, minimal fields, simple structure.

---

#### 2.5. Worksheet Integration Principle
**Use when:** Delivering teaching content

**Pattern:**
The worksheet should serve as complete outline when filled in.

**Quality test:** Could someone who's never seen your video use just the completed worksheet to implement?

**If yes:** Good worksheet.
**If no:** Add more structure/guidance.

---

#### 2.5. Indoctrination Video 1 Worksheet Structure
**Use when:** Planning Video 1 (WWWW)

**Pattern:**
Worksheet with sections for:
1. WHAT (topic/promise)
2. WHY #1 - Importance (3-5 bullet points)
3. WHY #2 - Differentiation (3-5 ways you're different)
4. WHEN (date/time + evergreen urgency)
5. "So if you" statements (minimum 5)

**Use:** Fill out BEFORE recording. Use as teleprompter/outline while recording.

---

#### 2.5. Webinar Theme Formula Options
**Use when:** Creating webinar title or core promise

**Pattern:**
Three formula options:
1. "How to X without Y" (outcome without objection)
2. "How I did X" (specific result with proof)
3. "The X System for Y" (methodology for outcome)

**Choose based on:**
- Market sophistication
- Your credibility level
- Primary objection to address

---

#### 2.5. Five So-If-You Minimum Rule
**Use when:** Creating Video 1

**Pattern:**
Include minimum of 5 "So if you" statements in every Video 1.

**Distribution:** Spread throughout video, not all at once.

---

#### 2.5. Specific Skepticism List (What They Hate)
**Use when:** Planning WHY #2 (Differentiation) component

- No actual teaching
- Fake scarcity
- Impossible promises

**Then:** Position your approach as opposite of each thing they hate.

---

#### 2.5. Situations-to-Solutions Cross-Reference Method
**Use when:** Using Bag of Tricks worksheet to create content

**Pattern:**
Create matrix:
- Rows: Situations (problems prospects face)
- Columns: Solutions (things you teach/provide)
- Cells: How each solution addresses each situation

**Purpose:** See which solutions solve multiple problems (prioritize teaching these) and which problems need multiple solutions (address in different modules).

---

#### 2.5. The Subconscious Seed Planting Technique
**Use when:** Pre-selling webinar offer in indoctrination videos

**Pattern:**
Mention the webinar offer obliquely without directly pitching.

**Example in Video 2:** "Now, if you want help implementing this systematically, I'll share something at the end of the webinar that might help. But for now, let me show you how to do this yourself..."

**Why it works:** Plants seed of offer without triggering sales resistance. By webinar, they're already expecting/wanting the offer.

---

#### 2.5. Familiarity Breeds Conversion
**Use when:** Planning number of touchpoints before webinar

2. Thank you page (liquidator)
3. Confirmation email
4. Video 1 email
5. Video 2 email
6. 4 reminder emails

**Minimum:** 8 touchpoints. **Don't fear:** "Giving away too much." More help = more trust = more sales.

---

#### 2.5. Registration Doesn't Equal Attendance
**Use when:** Setting expectations for webinar attendance

**Pattern:**
Industry standard: 25-30% show rate without indoctrination.

**Use when:** Understanding what skepticism to address

**Pattern:**
Prospects have TWO forms of skepticism:
1. Skepticism about YOUR ability to help them
2. Skepticism about THEIR ability to help themselves

**Both must be addressed** through demonstration and results in advance, not argumentation.

**Solutions:**
