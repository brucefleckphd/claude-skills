# Carlton Testimonials - Step 6 of the Simple Writing System

"Testimonials that work are short, specific and spicy."

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing testimonials for sales pages
- Gathering testimonials from customers
- Improving weak testimonials
- Structuring third-party proof sections
- Creating credibility through social proof

## The Testimonial Philosophy

### What Testimonials Do

Testimonials offer **third-party validation** for what you are saying.

> "I'm the best." → If YOU say it, it's just empty bragging.
> "He's the best." → If SOMEONE ELSE says it, it's backed up.

### You Need Multiple Testimonials

Carlton's rule: **At least 3 testimonials, preferably more.**

Why? Because one testimonial could be your mom. Two could be friends. Three or more creates pattern recognition - "other people are experiencing this too."

---

## The Short, Specific, Spicy Formula

### Short

- Get to the point
- No rambling
- Maximum impact per word
- Can be read in seconds

**Too Long:**
> "I just wanted to take a moment to write to you and let you know how much I've appreciated working with you over the past several months. When I first started, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say that the experience has been quite positive overall and I would recommend it to others..."

**Just Right:**
> "$287,000 the first week! I immediately produced my first sales letter ever... and it brought in $287,000 the first week!"

### Specific

- Real numbers
- Real results
- Real timeframes
- Real details that couldn't be made up

**Vague (Bad):**
> "Great product! I really enjoyed it and saw some nice results."

**Specific (Good):**
> "In the last 3 months conversions on my website have gone through the roof. Last week we had 17 sales ($300 info product) with less than 300 unique visitors to the site, which is by far the best month we ever had in just 1 week."

### Spicy

- Emotional punch
- Memorable language
- Personality shines through
- Makes you feel something

**Bland:**
> "The course helped me improve my copywriting."

**Spicy:**
> "After listening to John for less than an hour, my mind caught fire and everything fell into place."

## The Ideal Testimonial Elements

### 1. Famous or Credentialed Person
- Name recognition
- Title or position
- Company that matters

**Example:**
> "I started working for internet marketer Russell Brunson as a full-time copywriter... Thanks to implementing the quick-start copywriting secrets John revealed in his course, the letter ended up pulling in $340,000 in 7 days." - Kevin Hill, head writer for Russell Brunson

### 2. Huge Specific Claim
- Numbers that impress
- Results that seem almost unbelievable
- But ARE believable because they're specific

**Examples:**
- "$287,000 the first week"
- "$10 million in one day"
- "tripled my sales in a month"
- "511% increase in conversions"

### 3. Interesting Story
- Before/after transformation
- Struggle that's relatable
- Moment of breakthrough

**Example:**
> "Before I discovered John Carlton I had NO IDEA how to write good copy... and I'll admit I was pretty skeptical about investing in his programs... Well let me tell you that John's teaching have not only helped me increase conversions by over 511%, but John has been one of the backbones to me earning a high six-figures annually online."

## Voice Authenticity Requirements

### Different Voices

All your testimonials should have **different "voices"** - the words they use should be different from each other.

**Why this matters:**
- If all testimonials sound the same, they look fake
- Real people speak differently
- Variety proves authenticity

### Don't Over-Edit

When gathering testimonials:
- Write down what they say **word-for-word**
- Keep their verbal tics and expressions
- Don't clean up grammar too much
- Real people don't speak perfectly

**Too polished (suspicious):**
> "The Simple Writing System provided excellent value and comprehensive instruction that enabled me to achieve significant business results."

**Authentic (believable):**
> "The course was everything I hoped it would be and I can't say that about most Internet training I've done."

---

## Testimonial Believability Boosters

### Add Specific Details
- Full name (with permission)
- City or state
- Profession or company
- Photo if possible

### Consider Audio/Video
- Very hard to fake
- Shows real person
- Emotional impact higher
- Online audiences expect this

### Results-Based Over Feeling-Based

**Feeling-based (weak):**
> "Anne's a great person and I really enjoyed working with her..."

**Results-based (strong):**
> "Using just ONE tip John gave us increased our mail response by 32%. This means an additional $2,000 in profit for every 1000 letters."

## How to Get Good Testimonials

### The Ask

When someone tells you something good about your product:

> "Dude, you owe me a testimonial."

Simple. Direct. Effective.

### The Questions

If they don't know what to say, prompt them with:
1. What was your situation BEFORE?
2. What specific results did you get?
3. How quickly did you see results?
4. What would you tell someone on the fence?

### The Follow-Up

Best testimonials often come from:
- Follow-up emails weeks/months later
- Customer service interactions
- Unsolicited feedback
- Social media mentions

## Bad Testimonial Red Flags

### Avoid These:
- Focus on the person, not results
- Vague praise without specifics
- Too short to be meaningful
- Too long and rambling
- All sound the same voice
- No credentials or identification
- Purely emotional, no evidence

### The "Relative/Friend" Test

If a testimonial sounds like it could have been written by a relative or friend who never actually used the product, it fails.

---

## Mandatory Workflow

### Step 1: Inventory Existing Testimonials
- List all testimonials you have
- Rate each: Short? Specific? Spicy?
- Identify gaps

### Step 2: Gather New Testimonials
- Ask customers directly
- Mine customer service interactions
- Check social media mentions
- Follow up with success stories

### Step 3: Edit for Short, Specific, Spicy
For each testimonial:
- [ ] Is it short enough?
- [ ] Are there specific numbers/results?
- [ ] Does it have emotional punch?
- [ ] Does it sound authentic?

### Step 4: Check Voice Variety
- [ ] Do testimonials sound like different people?
- [ ] Are different perspectives represented?
- [ ] Is there variety in format?

### Step 5: Add Credibility Boosters
- [ ] Full names (with permission)
- [ ] Titles/companies
- [ ] Photos where possible
- [ ] Audio/video for key testimonials
