# Carlton Features-Benefits - Step 4 of the Simple Writing System

"You need to know exactly what benefit your prospects are after."

## When to Use This Skill

- Converting product features into benefits
- Creating the master list for bullets
- Understanding what really sells
- Bridging technical specs to emotional appeal
- Building the foundation for compelling copy

## The Features-Benefits Philosophy

### The Fundamental Distinction

**Feature:** The physicalness of what you're selling or the statistics.
**Benefit:** What the thing (or one of its features) DOES for someone.

### The Pencil Example

**Feature:** The pencil has a hunk of rubber on one end.
**Benefit:** You can make a mistake and the mistake will vanish.

---

## The "That Means" Technique

### The Master Method

After you write a feature, think: **"...that means..."** and follow with the benefit.

**Formula:**
[Feature] ...that means... [Benefit]

**Example:**
- Feature: "24-hour battery life"
- That means: "You'll never be stuck with a dead phone when you need it most"

### Going Deeper

Often you can chain "that means" to get to deeper benefits:

**Level 1:** "The battery lasts 24 hours"
**That means:** "You don't have to charge every day"
**That means:** "You never miss important calls or messages"
**That means:** "Your business keeps running even when you forget to plug in"
**That means:** "You never lose a sale because you were unreachable"

The deeper you go, the more emotional and compelling the benefit becomes.

## The Real Benefit Desired

### Find The Deep Desire

> "You need to know exactly what benefit your prospects are after."

**Example from Carlton:**
> "Day traders psychologically resemble gamblers or cocaine addicts. Most don't care how much money they have in the bank, but how much they 'scored'. Saying: 'You'll make more money' doesn't appeal nearly as much as: 'You're gonna score big'."

### The Subtlety

You can't always go right out and say the deep benefit. Sometimes you imply it while saying something more socially acceptable.

**Surface benefit:** "Make more money"
**Deep benefit:** "Experience the thrill of winning"
**What you write:** "Score big on your next trade" (implies both)

## Finding The Weak Point

### Market Analysis

Once you understand features and benefits:
> "Find the weak point in the market. Then you can step up and say: 'Everyone else says this, and here's what I've got for you: It's different, it's new, etc...'"

### Questions to Ask

- What does the competition claim?
- Where do they fall short?
- What do customers complain about?
- What's the unspoken desire not being met?
- What's the obvious solution no one's offering?

---

## Mandatory Workflow

### Step 1: List All Features
Write down every feature of your product/service:
- Physical attributes
- Technical specifications

- Processes or steps

### Step 2: Apply "That Means" to Each
For each feature:
- [ ] Write the feature
- [ ] Add "...that means..."
- [ ] Write the first-level benefit

### Step 3: Categorize Benefits
Sort benefits into:
- [ ] Practical benefits
- [ ] Emotional benefits
- [ ] Social benefits
- [ ] Health benefits
- [ ] Transformation benefits

### Step 4: Identify Real Desire
For your specific market:
- [ ] What do they REALLY want (not what they say)?
- [ ] What's the deep psychological benefit?
- [ ] How can you imply it without saying it directly?

### Step 5: Apply 4 Horsemen Check
For each major benefit:
- [ ] Is it FAST enough?
- [ ] Is it EASY enough?
- [ ] Is it SIMPLE enough?
- [ ] Is it CHEAP enough (or good value)?

### Step 6: Find Market Weak Point
- [ ] What's competition NOT offering?
- [ ] What's the unmet desire?
- [ ] How can you position against the gap?
