## How to Use

1. **Start with Pentad** - Study B1 (Introduction Pentad) to understand the five objectives
2. **Build Authority** - Use B2-B6 to establish credibility in first 5 minutes
3. **Get Commitment** - Use B7-B8 to lock in early agreement
4. **Handle Objections** - Use B9-B12 to preemptively address resistance
5. **Create Anticipation** - Use B13-B14 to build hope and mystery
6. **Validate** - Does your intro make them NEED to stay for content and close?

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for categorized list with one-line descriptions.

## The Introduction Pentad (Master Framework)

**Every introduction must accomplish these five objectives:**

1. **AUTHORITY** (3-5 minutes)
   - Establish credibility quickly
   - Four Pillars: Results + Positioning + Celebrity + Testimonials
   - 5-in-5 Rule: Five testimonials in first five minutes

2. **COMMITMENT** (2-3 minutes)
   - Get early yeses before content
   - Mega-Commitment Script: Written promise
   - Sound Check Sell: 20-30 creative agreements

3. **OBJECTIONS** (2-3 minutes)
   - Handle resistance before it blocks
   - Use Objection Triad to diagnose
   - Apply appropriate formula (Disagreement, Agreement, or Excluding)

4. **HOPE** (2-3 minutes)
   - Create positive future vision
   - Time Machine Technique: Transport them to success
   - Make transformation feel achievable

5. **MYSTERY** (Woven throughout)
   - Create curiosity gap
   - First-Last Technique: Best content saved
   - Leave breadcrumbs to keep them engaged

## The Tactical Sequence

```
B8 Sound Check → B2+B3+B6 Authority → B4+B5 Testimonials →
B7 Commitment → B9-B12 Objections → B13 Hope → B14 Mystery Tease
```

## Core Principles

1. **Build intro THIRD** - After you know your content and close
2. **Authority in 5 minutes** - Don't take 20 minutes to establish credibility
3. **Early commitment matters** - Get yeses before teaching anything
4. **Pre-handle objections** - Address resistance before it forms
5. **Hope + Mystery balance** - Make success feel possible AND interesting
