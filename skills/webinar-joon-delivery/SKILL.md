## Framework Details

### 1. Micro-Commitments Show-Up Strategy
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**Components:**
- Physical welcome gift box shipped immediately
- Pre-training modules (6 months of content before live)
- Video follow-up series from signup to event
- Venue walkthrough video day before

**Principle:** More micro-commitments = higher show-up rate. Money is in backend, not ticket sales.

---

### 2. Pre-Training Objection Crusher
**Tier:** 2

Address "event is too far away" objection: "Pre-training starts immediately so we maximize our time together." Gets everyone to same starting point.

---

### 3. Venue Walkthrough Video
**Tier:** 2

Day before: Film actual venue, registration process, schedule. "Doors 8am, bonus videos 8:30, start 9am sharp. I start on time with or without you."

---

### 4. Refund Request Guilt Sequence
**Tier:** 3

7-email autoresponder: Give full refund → Continue giving value and gifts → "If you change your mind, contact us." Saves ~20% of refund requests.

---

### 5. Hotel Negotiation Power Framework
**Tier:** 3

**Mindset:** Empty room makes them $0 - power is with you.
**Process:** Contact 25+ hotels → Never reveal budget first → Counter with 50% of quote → Wait silently → Negotiate free equipment after price.
**Benchmark:** Always aim for 50% of first quote.

---

### 6. Event Flow Manual System
**Tier:** 2

33-page manual: Event Preparation, Setup Day, Live Event, After Event. Includes equipment photos, costing sheet, liability forms. "This book is for your team. Your only job is content delivery."

---

### 7. Unexpected Gift Value-Add
**Tier:** 2

Don't hand out bonuses as if nothing. Build value during event → "How many want this?" → Pause → "Everyone gets it!" Creates wow moment vs. taking for granted.

---

### 8. State Change Energy Management
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**Tools:**
- Written exercises (output creates retention)
- Partner shares (stand up, move around)
- Class shares (pass mic)
- Stand-up exercises (compliance + energy)
- Ban laptops (kill energy)

**When:** Throughout multi-hour events, especially after lunch.

---

### 9. Mental State Change Through Questions
**Tier:** 2

Convert statements to questions: Instead of "This is important" → "How many would agree this is important?" + hand raise. Questions hook the mind - can't ignore them.

---

### 10. PowerPoint vs Flip Chart Strategic Use
**Tier:** 2

**PowerPoint:** Selling (visual sales assets)
**Flip Charts:** Teaching and seeding

Key advantage of flip chart: Stays visible for hours (price marinade). PowerPoint slides disappear.

**Example:** Write "$10,000 coaching" on flip chart → Teach on PowerPoint for 2 hours → $10K still visible → marinade.

---

### 11. Event Context and Rules Setting
**Tier:** 2

For 50+ person events:
- Set start song = be seated signal
- Countdown timer for breaks
- "Breaks are NOT Q&A" - Needs of many outweigh needs of one
- Start on time every session
- "Starting late is disrespectful to the 99 who showed up on time"

---

## How to Use These Frameworks

**Pre-Event (Show-Up):**
1. Ship welcome box immediately (Framework 1)
2. Provide pre-training content (Framework 2)
3. Send venue walkthrough day before (Framework 3)
4. Set up refund sequence (Framework 4)

**Venue & Logistics:**
1. Negotiate using power framework (Framework 5)
2. Give team the Event Flow Manual (Framework 6)

**During Event:**
1. Set rules in first 5 minutes (Framework 11)
2. Manage energy constantly (Framework 8)
3. Convert statements to questions (Framework 9)
4. Use flip chart for seeding, PPT for selling (Framework 10)
5. Deliver unexpected gifts (Framework 7)

## Critical Reminders

1. **Micro-commitments drive show-up** - More steps before event = higher attendance
2. **Energy requires active management** - After lunch is danger zone
3. **Never reveal budget first** - Hotel negotiation power is yours
4. **Flip charts marinade** - Price stays visible for hours
5. **Set rules early** - Prevents overwhelm and Q&A hijacking
6. **Your only job is content** - Team handles everything else
