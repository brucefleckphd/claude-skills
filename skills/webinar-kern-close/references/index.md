# Kern Close Frameworks - Complete Index

Quick reference for all 30 frameworks in the webinar-kern-close skill.

## Master Systems (Tier 1-2)

### K1. Ultimate Offer Structure (12 Steps)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 2 | **Type:** structural

12-step structure (flexible—don't need all, don't need exact order): (1) NLP confirmation/transition, (2) Reason why intro, (3) Big benefit, (4) Just for you, (5) Walkthrough of product, (6) Price, (7) Booster #1 - price drop for first X people, (8) Risk reversal, (9) Booster #2 - first bonus, (10) Recap, (11) Repeat booster #2 or add bonus/deadline, (12) Repeat risk reversal. Structure allows desire to build continuously while showing call-to-action URL repeatedly. Each booster resets attention and adds value.

**Use when:** Building your complete close section with maximum conversion elements

**Conditional:** Can compress to fewer steps for simpler offers. Can add more boosters for complex high-ticket offers. Core elements (product, price, risk reversal, bonus) are non-negotiable.

### K2. Carltonian Formula (Expanded)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 2 | **Type:** tactical

Three-step offer introduction from John Carlton: (1) Here's what I got - describe the product/offer, (2) Here's what it'll do for you - benefits/outcomes, (3) Here's what I want you to do next - clear call to action. This is simpler than full 12-step sequence, works well for liquidator offers and simple pitches. Straightforward, no manipulation, just clear presentation. Transition into offer with: 'What I just gave you is an overview of the exact same system I used to [result]... and now that you know WHAT to do, I'm going to show you exactly HOW to do it.'

**Use when:** Transitioning from teaching to selling, introducing your offer simply and clearly

**Conditional:** Use Carlton 3-step formula for simple/liquidator offers. Use 12-step sequence for main webinar offers. The transition ('now that you know what, I'll show you how') only works if you actually taught the 'what' in tutorial section. If you didn't teach first, this transition falls flat. Order must be: teach WHAT, then transition, then offer HOW.

---

### K3. Reason Why to Take Action NOW
**Node:** 6.6 | **Tier:** 2 | **Type:** tactical

Every video should have a purpose and ask for it. But don't just give reason WHY to take action - give reason why to take action RIGHT NOW. Not just 'why do this' but 'why do this today/right now'. The 'right now' component is critical. Without urgency, people say 'I'll think about it' and never return. With legitimate urgency, they make decision in the moment. Urgency must be real/legitimate, not manufactured scarcity.

**Use when:** Creating calls to action, building urgency, getting immediate response vs 'I'll do it later'

**Conditional:** If you give reason to act but not reason to act NOW, most defer decision and forget. If you create fake urgency, it trains people not to believe future urgency. Legitimate urgency includes: one-time offer (won't see again), bonus expiring, limited quantity (if true), deadline for discount, time-sensitive opportunity. The reason for urgency should be logical, not just 'because I said so.'

---

## The 12-Step Sequence (Tier 3)

### K4. NLP Confirmation Opening (Step 1)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Use triple-fact pattern at start of close: 'Here's some things I think are probably true about you. You're here with me right now [fact 1], you're listening to this webinar [fact 2], and you know that selling with webinars is a good idea and if you use this approach, it's probably going to do well for your business [what you want them to accept]. And that's why I've created [product name].' Establishes agreement pattern before making offer.

**Use when:** Opening your close section with psychological agreement momentum

**Conditional:** Can use any NLP transition pattern here - triple fact, psychic, global, or hype-free. Choose based on audience and tone you want.

---

### K5. Reason Why Intro (Step 2)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

After NLP confirmation: 'That's why I've created [product name].' Immediately establishes product as solution to what they just agreed they need. Creates logical flow: you have this need → I created this solution for you. Reason-why advertising applied to product introduction.

**Use when:** Introducing your product after NLP transition

**Conditional:** Product name should be descriptive or intriguing. Immediately after naming it, explain what it does (Step 3).

---

### K6. Big Benefit Statement (Step 3)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Format: 'This program is specifically designed to help you [list big benefit statements].' List 2-4 primary benefits, not detailed - that comes later. Example: 'Build a list, hold a webinar, and make sales all within 28 days.' These are outcome-focused, not feature-focused. Sets expectation for what product accomplishes. More detail comes in walkthrough (Step 5).

**Use when:** After naming product, to immediately communicate core value

**Conditional:** Keep benefits high-level here. If you get too detailed, you dilute impact and make later walkthrough redundant. Save supporting detail for Step 5.

---

### K7. If You Want To Series (Step 4)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Create series of 'if you want to' statements, each on own slide: 'If you want to build authority... if you want to create loyal following... if you want to get highly responsive list... if you want to sell like crazy... and you want to do it all in 28 days, then this program is specifically for you.' Each statement gets them nodding. Accumulation creates momentum. End with 'then this is specifically for YOU' to make it personal.

**Use when:** Building desire through accumulation of specific benefits

**Conditional:** Each 'if you want' should be benefit they genuinely want. If they don't want it, don't list it. 3-5 statements optimal. More than 7 gets tedious.

---

### K8. Big Picture Overview (Step 5 Part A)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Say 'Here's how we'll do it' then show product structure. If course: list modules/weeks. If service: list phases. If software: list main features. Keep very high level - just names/titles. Example: 'This product consists of four modules delivered weekly. Module 1: Recon and Registrants. Module 2: Indoctrination. Module 3: Ultimate Sales Webinar. Module 4: Maximize Revenue.' No details yet - just roadmap.

**Use when:** After desire is built, showing product structure at high level

**Conditional:** If product has clear structure (modules, phases, components), show it. If product is single thing, skip to benefit breakdown. Don't force structure if doesn't exist.

---

### K9. Benefit Breakdown (Step 5 Part B)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

For each module/component: 'In [component name], we're going to discover [thing] so you can [benefit].' Multiple slides per component, each with 2-4 'benefit so you can' statements. Cover every major component. Turn every feature into benefit using 'so you can' formula. This is detailed walkthrough showing everything they get.

**Use when:** After showing structure, detailing what's in each component

**Conditional:** Spend more slides on more valuable components. Minimum one slide per component. Complex components may need 2-3 slides.

---

### K10. Value Build Statement (Step 6 Part A)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Say 'By now you're probably wondering about the price' then build value before stating it. Methods: (1) Comparative pricing - 'Last class I sold was $7,800 and sold out. Class before that was $10,000 and sold out. This class is equally if not more valuable.' (2) Competitor pricing - 'Rolls-Royce Ghost is $350K. Bentley Mulsanne is $300K. Neither have the features of this car.' Create expectation they'll pay significantly more than you'll actually charge.

**Use when:** Before revealing price, to anchor high value in their mind

**Conditional:** Use real comparisons, never fake ones. If you've sold similar before, cite that price. If competitors charge more, cite that. If neither, use value of problems it solves.

---

### K11. Payment Options Presentation (Step 6 Part B)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Show installment price first: 'Three payments of $500' (or whatever). Let that sink in - it's already good deal compared to value build. Then show pay-in-full option: 'And if you want to save $500, you can make single payment of $1,000.' This makes deal even better. Installments make it accessible, pay-in-full incentivizes immediate cash.

**Use when:** After value build, revealing price with payment flexibility

**Conditional:** Always offer payment plan if price is over $300. Over $1000, payment plan is essential for many buyers. Save amount should be meaningful (10-20% of total).

---

## The Booster System (Tier 3)

### K12. First Booster - Price Drop (Step 7)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Say 'But it gets better. The first 10 to order [or first 5, first X people] can make three payments of $300' (or reduced amount). This is substantial savings - $600 in example. Creates scarcity (limited spots) and urgency (first movers get deal). Can also offer even better pay-in-full for first movers: 'Or save even more with single payment of $750.' Now it's 'insanely good deal.'

**Use when:** After showing price, to create urgency and reward fast action

**Conditional:** Discount should be meaningful (20-40% off). Quantity should be credible - not 'first 1000' for small list. Can also use time deadline instead of quantity.

---

### K13. Guarantee as Booster (Step 8)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Frame guarantee as another reason deal is better: 'But it still gets better. On top of the great bargain and great material, you're protected by the best guarantee ever.' Then give detailed walkthrough of guarantee across multiple slides. Don't just say 'satisfaction guaranteed' - spell out: how long to try it, how long to implement it, how to get refund, what happens if they ask. Make each guarantee point its own slide for emphasis.

**Use when:** After price drop booster, to eliminate risk and add another conversion boost

**Conditional:** Guarantee must be real and generous. If you're nervous about refunds, your product probably isn't good enough. Strong guarantee increases sales more than it increases refunds.

---

### K14. Multiple Guarantee Slides for Emphasis
**Node:** 6.2 | **Tier:** 4 | **Type:** tactical

Break guarantee into multiple slides, one point per slide. Example: Slide 1: '30 days to check it out.' Slide 2: 'Another 9,000 years to implement it' (obviously exaggeration for effect). Slide 3: 'If you don't like it, send it back for refund.' Each point gets emphasis through isolation. Slower pace allows points to sink in. URL still at bottom of every guarantee slide.

**Use when:** Presenting your guarantee to maximize reassurance

**Conditional:** If guarantee is simple, 1-2 slides enough. If comprehensive (multiple periods, conditions, bonuses), use 3-5 slides. Each meaningful element deserves own slide.

---

### K15. First Bonus as Booster (Step 9)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Frame as pushing them over edge: 'But it still gets even better. Listen, if the guarantee wasn't enough and the great price wasn't enough to push you over the edge, I want to do one even better for you. That's why I've created brand new [Bonus #1 name].' Then sell the bonus with 'benefit so you can' statements across multiple slides. Bonus is free but treat it as valuable. Build desire for it.

**Use when:** After guarantee, adding more value to already compelling offer

**Conditional:** Bonus should be genuinely valuable and relevant. Don't add junk just to have bonus. Better one great bonus than three mediocre ones. Can add multiple bonuses - this is first.

---

### K16. Additional Bonuses (Steps 10-11)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

After first bonus: 'But it still gets even better. Now I've also added bonus number two.' Same structure as bonus 1: name it, sell it with 'benefit so you can' statements. Can add bonus 3, 4, etc. Each bonus: (1) resets attention, (2) adds value, (3) shows URL again, (4) gives new reason to buy. Pattern: they think 'surely that's all' then you add more. Creates 'this is almost too good' feeling.

**Use when:** Continuing to build value after first bonus

**Conditional:** Don't need to add bonuses if you don't have valuable ones. But if you have 2-4 solid bonuses, spread them throughout close rather than dumping all at once. Each one is conversion opportunity.

---

### K17. Bonuses Don't Count as Pitch
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** principled

Psychological principle: while talking about bonuses, it doesn't count as pitching in audience's mind because you're giving them free stuff. They're receptive because you're adding value, not pushing them to buy. This allows you to continue close longer without resistance. Meanwhile, URL stays visible, so while they're happily learning about free bonuses, they're constantly seeing where to buy.

**Use when:** Understanding why you can add multiple bonuses without feeling salesy

**Conditional:** This is why you can have 3-4 bonus sections but shouldn't repeat main pitch 3-4 times. Bonuses = value add. Repeated pitch = pressure.

---

### K18. The Recap (Step 10)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Say 'Let me wrap it all up for you. This has been a lot.' Then list: (1) Main product, (2) All bonuses by name, (3) Price discount if ordering now/in first X, (4) Guarantee summary. Format: 'To be clear, first of all, I'm giving you [main product]. I'm also giving you [bonus 1], [bonus 2], [bonus 3]. On top of that, you need to understand this is very valuable. If you order before end of webinar [or are in first 10], you get discount of X dollars. That means instead of paying [regular price], you pay [discounted price]. On top of that great discount and incredible bonuses, you're protected by [guarantee].'

**Use when:** After all bonuses are presented, before time deadline

**Conditional:** Recap is essential when you have multiple bonuses. Without it, they forget half of what they're getting. Recap creates 'wow, all that?' moment.

---

### K19. Time Deadline as Final Booster (Step 11)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Acknowledge offer is great, create urgency: 'Now, listen, this is a great offer. Lots of people are going to take me up on this for obvious reasons - it's simply an incredible value. You can get it today at [URL], and I urge you to do so, especially considering [warning]. I plan to raise the price this week if there is even availability by end of week.' Then explain: 'This is special price for everyone who attended this webinar. Not available to general public. Can't get this discount month from now. I want to reward people who take fast action and appreciate your time being here.'

**Use when:** After recap, to create final urgency push

**Conditional:** Deadline must be real. Can be: price increase, product going away, bonuses expiring, limited spots. Don't fake deadlines - that's unethical and illegal. Make deadline reasonable (24hrs-7 days).

---

### K20. Final Triple-Fact Close (Step 12)
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Return to triple-fact NLP: 'You've watched this entire presentation [fact 1], and you want webinars that sell your stuff - otherwise you wouldn't be here [fact 2]. And listen, you're still here, so you know this is an excellent value [implanted acceptance]. Therefore, go ahead, take advantage of this incredible discount, the amazing bonuses, and the can't-lose guarantee now. You have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain. Go to [URL] and enroll today.'

**Use when:** After deadline, as final push before Q&A or end

**Conditional:** Final close should be confident but not desperate. If you've done job right, they're already convinced. This just gives final permission to act.

---

## CTA & Conversion (Tier 2-3)

### K21. Call to Action URL Omnipresence
**Node:** 6.2 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

From Step 7 (first booster) onward, put call-to-action URL at bottom of every slide. As you explain benefits, bonuses, guarantees, recaps - URL is always visible. Say URL out loud frequently. Be specific about what happens: 'Go to [URL], choose your payment plan, you'll immediately get login info, you'll get email with login, then every week you'll get new lesson.' Tell them exactly what to expect.

**Use when:** From first price reveal through end of close - every slide

**Conditional:** URL must be simple and memorable. If complex, use redirect. Repeat URL every 2-3 slides minimum. Every time you give new reason to buy, remind them where to buy.

---

### K22. Button Copy That Removes Sales Resistance
**Node:** 6.8 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Instead of generic 'Click Here to Add to Cart' or 'Buy Now', use desire-based button copy that expresses what they want. Example: 'Yes, I want to sell on webinars' instead of 'Buy Now'. This is agreement with their desire, not submitting to your demand. Psychologically different. They're saying yes to what they want, not complying with 'buy this'. The button becomes expression of their will, not yours. Makes clicking feel like taking control of their outcome rather than being sold to.

**Use when:** Writing button copy, reducing sales resistance, creating desire-based CTAs

**Conditional:** Use desire-based button copy when you've properly identified their wants (Question 1 of recon). If you don't know what they want, you can't write desire-based copy. Generic 'Buy Now' is okay as fallback but doesn't leverage psychology as well. For very transactional purchases (tools, utilities), 'Buy Now' may work fine. For aspirational purchases (outcomes, transformations), desire-based works better.

---

### K23. Timed Buy Button Appearance
**Node:** 6.7 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Buy button should appear at the moment you mention the price in the video. Not before (seems pushy), not too long after (they may have decided already). In Leadpages/Megaphone, you set button to appear after X minutes/seconds. Best practice: Appear right when price is mentioned (makes it easy to buy at peak desire moment). Can also delay appearance to extend decision time, but risk losing people who wanted to buy immediately.

**Use when:** Timing the appearance of buy button in video sales letter, optimizing conversion timing

**Conditional:** If button appears too early (before price mentioned), seems aggressive and confuses flow. If button appears too late (after full pitch), some ready buyers may leave before seeing button. Time it to price mention as baseline, then test variations. Some products benefit from button appearing during story after price (extends exposure). Test what works for your offer.

---

### K24. One-Time Offer Deadline Strategy
**Node:** 6.4 | **Tier:** 2 | **Type:** tactical

For one-time offer after registration, deadline creation is simple and logical: 'This usually costs $X. You can have it for Y% off right now as a special marketing test exclusively available to people who have registered for this webinar. I want you to understand though, I will not be displaying this offer again. This is only available to you right now. Whether or not you decide to choose it, I wish you the best of luck. But if you want this, I can promise you one thing: You will never see it at this low of a price again. So once this video is over, the offer has expired.' This is logical because they're on one-time offer page they won't see again.

**Use when:** Creating urgency for liquidator offer, making offer available only once, enforcing scarcity

**Conditional:** Only use 'never see this again' if it's TRUE. If you re-display offer to same people, you train them not to believe future deadlines. For liquidator offer, can legitimately only show once because they won't return to thank-you page. If you email about offer later, you've broken your word. Stick to deadline or don't use this language.

---

### K25. Buy Button Visibility Extension Story
**Node:** 6.5 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

After making offer (price, CTA, guarantee, deadline), tell a story about how you used your product to get specific benefit. This keeps the buy button in front of viewer longer while continuing to build desire. The story should be: (1) True, (2) Relatable, (3) Show specific result from using what you're selling, (4) Continue building desire while button is visible. This extends decision time and gives them more reasons to buy while they can still act.

**Use when:** Extending time buy button is visible, telling proof stories after making offer, increasing order value

**Conditional:** Use this if your offer can be made in under 2 minutes (too quick). Don't use if your offer already takes 5+ minutes (too long). Story should add new angle or proof not already covered. Can be personal story or customer story. Must connect back to their desires. If story is boring or irrelevant, it hurts conversion rather than helping.

---

## Language Patterns (Tier 3)

### K26. Describe Components with 'So You Can'
**Node:** 6.3 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

When describing product components (modules, bonuses, features), always use formula: 'You get X SO YOU CAN Y.' X is the component/feature. Y is the benefit connected to their desires. Example: 'In module number one, you're going to learn five ways to start a conversation with a woman that doesn't make you sound creepy, SO YOU CAN always be confident that when you go up to approach a beautiful lady, she's going to be receptive to you and you won't feel weird.' The 'so you can' transforms features into benefits.

**Use when:** Describing what's included in offer, walking through modules or components, building value stack

**Conditional:** Use this for EVERY component you describe. Without 'so you can', you're just listing contents which isn't compelling. With it, you're showing outcome of each piece. The Y (benefit) should connect back to desires from Question 1 of recon. If you can't think of 'so you can' benefit for a component, either remove that component or you don't understand its value.

---

### K27. 'So You Can' Benefit Language
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 3 | **Type:** tactical

Core language pattern used throughout close. Every benefit statement should follow: 'You get/learn [thing] SO YOU CAN [desired outcome].' Transforms features into benefits by connecting to desires from recon. Used in: benefit breakdown (Step 5B), bonus presentation (Steps 9-11), component descriptions throughout.

**Use when:** Presenting any feature, component, or element of offer

**Conditional:** The outcome in 'so you can' must connect to desires identified in Question 1 of recon. If you don't know their desires, you can't use this pattern effectively.

---

### K28. Here's What I Got Formula (Carlton Formula)
**Node:** 6.2 | **Tier:** 2 | **Type:** tactical

Alternative to full 12-step for simpler offers. Three parts: (1) Here's what I got - describe product/offer clearly, (2) Here's what it'll do for you - benefits/outcomes connected to desires, (3) Here's what I want you to do next - single clear CTA. Same as K2 but listed separately as standalone reference.

**Use when:** Simplified close for liquidator or simple offers

**Conditional:** Use for simple/liquidator offers. Use 12-step for main webinar. Only works if you taught first.

---

## Transition & Supporting (Tier 3-4)

### K29. Live Q&A Transition
**Node:** 6.3 | **Tier:** 4 | **Type:** tactical

After final close: 'Now I'd like to invite you to stay for my favorite part of every presentation and that's the live Q&A. I am here with you live right now. If you'll give me just a second to go ahead and get everything set up so I can see your questions, I'll be right with you. You'll see in the little chat box, you can ask me questions and I'll answer some of the best questions coming in right now. Give me just a second.' Leave final slide up (with URL) during Q&A so they can buy while you answer questions.

**Use when:** Transitioning from recorded presentation to live Q&A if you're doing hybrid model

**Conditional:** If fully recorded/automated, skip this. If live, use this. If hybrid (recorded presentation + live Q&A), this transition is critical to shift from recorded to live mode.

---

### K30. 12-Step Teaser
**Node:** 6.1 | **Tier:** 1 | **Type:** structural

Understanding that the 12-step sequence is flexible. You don't necessarily need all 12 steps, and you don't need to do them in exact order. The core elements (product, price, risk reversal, bonus) are non-negotiable. The boosters are flexible based on offer complexity and audience. Some offers work with 6 steps, some need all 12.

**Use when:** Understanding the flexibility of the Ultimate Offer Structure

**Conditional:** Always include core elements. Add boosters based on offer complexity and conversion goals.

*Updated: 2025-12-18*
