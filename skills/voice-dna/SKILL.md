# Personal Brand DNA Extractor - Custom Override

> **CRITICAL**: This skill MUST access live social media feeds to capture authentic voice patterns. Polished marketing copy alone does NOT constitute voice DNA.

---

## Purpose

Extracts a person's unique brand DNA from existing materials and creates 8 AI-optimized files that power all copywriting and webinar systems with THEIR voice, THEIR stories, THEIR credentials.

---

## MANDATORY: Live Feed Verification

**Before creating ANY Voice DNA files, you MUST:**

1. **Access live social media** (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok)
2. **Capture REAL voice samples** - actual posts, comments, video transcripts
3. **Document casual patterns** - profanity, emoji usage, word stretching, capitalization
4. **Find unpolished content** - not marketing copy, but real talk

### Voice Verification Checklist

- [ ] Instagram captions analyzed (minimum 5 posts)
- [ ] YouTube video transcript(s) captured
- [ ] LinkedIn posts reviewed (not just profile)
- [ ] Casual writing patterns documented (profanity, emojis, ALL CAPS, stretched words)
- [ ] Speaking patterns documented (from video/audio)

**⚠️ DO NOT proceed to file creation without completing voice verification.**

## Process

### Phase 1: Source Collection (LIVE FEEDS REQUIRED)

1. **Request source materials** from user:
   - Website URL
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Instagram handle
   - YouTube channel
   - Any existing bios, presentations, testimonials

2. **Access live social media feeds**:
   - Open Instagram and scrape recent captions
   - Open YouTube and pull video transcripts
   - Review LinkedIn posts (not just profile)
   - Check other platforms mentioned

3. **Capture REAL voice samples**:
   - Copy actual posts verbatim
   - Note casual language patterns
   - Document emoji usage
   - Note profanity/casual language
   - Capture stretched words, ALL CAPS patterns

### Phase 2: Voice Verification (GATE)

**STOP and verify you have:**
- [ ] Minimum 3 real social media posts captured
- [ ] At least 1 video transcript excerpt
- [ ] Documented: profanity level, emoji patterns, capitalization habits
- [ ] Identified difference between polished/casual voice

**If missing**: Go back to Phase 1. Do not proceed.

### Phase 3: File Creation

Only after Phase 2 gate is passed:

1. Create 01-VOICE-AND-TONE.md with **Real Voice Samples section FIRST**
2. Create remaining files from static sources
3. Cross-reference voice patterns across all files
4. Ensure CLAUDE.md index references the voice standards

### Phase 4: Quality Check

- [ ] 01-VOICE-AND-TONE.md has verbatim social media quotes
- [ ] Casual patterns documented (not just professional voice)
- [ ] Platform-specific guidance included
- [ ] AI guidelines reflect REAL voice, not aspirational voice

## Failure Modes to Avoid

| Failure | Why It Happens | Prevention |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Polished voice only | Only used website/LinkedIn profile | Access Instagram, YouTube transcripts |
| Missing casual patterns | Skipped social media | Mandatory live feed check |
| Generic guidelines | Didn't capture real examples | Require verbatim quotes |
| Platform blindness | Treated all platforms same | Document platform-specific voice |

## Example Voice Capture

**BAD** (polished marketing copy):
> "Ashley Shaw helps ambitious women build automated, freedom-first businesses that scale without burnout."

**GOOD** (real Instagram voice):
> "Ever tried REALLY hard to work with a potential customer who ended up just sucking the damn life out of you? (Drop a 😬 if this made you instantly think of something 😂) It's disheartening AF, but also completely avoidable."

The second example tells you:
- Casual profanity OK ("damn", "AF")
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Emoji engagement prompts
- Self-deprecating/relatable tone
- Pain point first, then pivot to solution

*This override ensures Voice DNA captures how someone ACTUALLY sounds, not just how they want to sound.*
