# Hard Constraints (C1-C10) for Teaching Units

These constraints are non-negotiable. Any violation = automatic REVISE regardless of critic score.

## C1: Flash Length Cap
Flash sections contain ONE primary example and at most ONE backup angle. Total Flash length must NOT exceed the Gap section length. If your Flash has more than two examples, you have violated this constraint. Delete until you have one story and one backup.

## C2: Flash Structure — Three-Act Story
The default Flash architecture is a three-act story where the student commits to the wrong answer:
- **Act 1:** Setup — the situation
- **Act 2:** The student's instinct (which is wrong) — they see themselves in this
- **Act 3:** Reveal — why their instinct created a WORSE problem

If a personal artifact exists (like a CLAUDE.md file, a system, a document), build the Flash around SHOWING the artifact and asking a pivot question that forces the student to test the distinction against their own experience. The answer to that question IS the flash.

## C3: No Five-Example Cascades
The "5 parallel case studies" pattern is BANNED in Flash sections. It produces agreement, not revelation. One story told with full emotional depth lands harder than five told as summaries. If you need multiple examples, put them in Application (as exercises) or Reinforcement (as recurring encounters), NOT in Flash.

## C4: Contrast Maximum — 3 Pairs
Contrast sections contain a maximum of three parallel A/B pairs plus one summation ("money line"). The pattern is obvious after two pairs; the third confirms. Select the three sharpest pairs and discard the rest. Extra pairs belong in Application as "where you'll see this" exercises.

## C5: Application Leads with 24-Hour Action
The first element in every Application section is a concrete action the student does RIGHT NOW, before continuing. Requirements:
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Produces a tangible artifact (a list, a map, a template — NOT a thought)
- Applies the distinction to the student's ACTUAL situation
- Is phrased as "Do this now, before you read further"

## C6: Exercises Produce Artifacts, Not Thoughts
Every application exercise must result in something the student can see, share, or revisit. "Ask yourself..." prompts without written output are prohibited. Transform them: "Write down..." / "List..." / "Draw..." / "Fill in..."

## C7: Reinforcement is Designed Mechanics, Not Speeches
Every Reinforcement section must include:
1. **One daily environmental trigger** — fires on something the student encounters unavoidably every day (to-do list, inbox, calendar, project tool)
2. **One peer mechanism** — specific prompt for sharing with team, not generic "tell 3 people"
3. **One program callback** — reference to a specific session/module where this distinction resurfaces

Rhetorical paragraphs explaining why the distinction matters are BANNED in Reinforcement. The Flash already made the case. Reinforcement engineers repeated contact, not repeated argument.

## C8: Name Section — 15 Lines Maximum
The Name section contains: the label, the sub-name (if any), one sentence of framing, the diagnostic question, and the usage pattern. Nothing else. No re-teaching. No re-explaining. If your Name section exceeds 15 lines, you are re-teaching the distinction.

## C9: Total Unit Length — 250-350 Lines
Hard cap. This forces tighter editing and eliminates redundancy. If your unit exceeds 350 lines, cut the longest section first. The sections that typically run long (in order of typical bloat): Flash, Application, Reinforcement, Contrast.

## C10: Voice Guard — No Borrowed Terminology
Replace academic, technical, or other-people's terminology with YOUR native language. Specific commonly banned terms:
- "Antifragile" → "built to take hits" / "designed to absorb failure"
- "Graceful degradation" → "breaks without falling over"
- "Paradigm shift" → describe what specifically shifts
- Any term that requires the student to have read someone else's book

If YOU wouldn't say it while teaching in a room, it doesn't belong in the unit.
