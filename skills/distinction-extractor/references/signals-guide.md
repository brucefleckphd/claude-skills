# Signal Patterns for Distinction Extraction

When scanning source material for distinction candidates, watch for these patterns:

## Signal 1: Explicit Contrast
**Phrase pattern:** "The difference between X and Y..." / "X is not Y" / "Not X, but Y"

**What to listen for:**
- Direct statements comparing two things
- "I used to think X, now I think Y"
- "Most people do X, experts do Y"

**Example:** "The difference between freedom and relief is that freedom is choosing what you want, while relief is getting away from what you don't want."

**Candidate?** Usually YES — explicit contrasts are often core distinctions.

---

## Signal 2: Binary Framing
**Phrase pattern:** "There are two kinds of..." / "Either X or Y" / "You're doing one of two things"

**What to listen for:**
- Explicit either/or framings
- Categorizations into two groups
- "This person is in one camp or the other"

**Example:** "There are two kinds of entrepreneurs: those who see the problem and freeze, and those who see the problem and act."

**Candidate?** Probably YES — binary framing suggests someone is dividing a collapsed distinction.

---

## Signal 3: Before/After
**Phrase pattern:** "Before I learned this... after..." / "I used to... now I..."

**What to listen for:**
- Personal transformation stories
- Shifts in how someone sees things
- Realization moments that changed behavior

**Example:** "Before, I thought information was what I was missing. After I realized my students needed transformation, everything changed."

**Candidate?** Often YES, especially if the shift is about SEEING differently.

---

## Signal 4: Collapse Indicator
**Phrase pattern:** "People confuse X with Y" / "Everyone treats these as the same" / "They're actually different"

**What to listen for:**
- Direct callouts of confusion
- "Most of us use the same word for two different things"
- "This is what people get wrong about X"

**Example:** "People confuse strategy with tactics. They use the words interchangeably. But strategy is where you're going, and tactics is how you get there. Different things entirely."

**Candidate?** Usually YES — collapse indicators are strong signals of distinctions.

---

## Signal 5: Expert Observation
**Phrase pattern:** "What experts see..." / "Professionals notice..." / "The thing most people miss..."

**What to listen for:**
- References to expert perception vs novice perception
- "A real [expert] sees X; an amateur sees Y"
- "Here's what I look for that others don't"

**Example:** "A healthy forest manager sees which trees to harvest and which to leave. A novice sees just trees."

**Candidate?** Often YES — expert distinctions are valuable perceptual capacities.

---

## Signal 6: Breakdown Narrative
**Phrase pattern:** "The reason this fails..." / "What goes wrong..." / "Here's what people do that breaks down"

**What to listen for:**
- Analysis of failure patterns
- "The breakdown is because..."
- Stories where someone did X and it backfired

**Example:** "People think if they just work harder, the problem goes away. But if the problem is a structural one, working harder just makes the breakdown deeper."

**Candidate?** Sometimes YES — if the breakdown reveals an implicit distinction being violated.

---

## Signal 7: Reframing
**Phrase pattern:** "It's not about X, it's about Y" / "What's really happening is..." / "People think it's X, but it's actually Y"

**What to listen for:**
- Corrections of common misunderstandings
- Paradigm shift language
- "The key isn't X; the key is Y"

**Example:** "It's not about whether you're smart enough. It's about whether you have the right framework for seeing the problem."

**Candidate?** Often YES — reframings frequently uncover distinctions.

---

## Signal 8: Named Pairs
**Phrase pattern:** Any A vs B structure that's been given explicit names

**What to listen for:**
- "Owner vs Victim"
- "Leverage vs Force"
- "Opportunity vs Rescue"
- Concept pairs that appear repeatedly

**Example:** "There's a fundamental difference between being in Victim state and being in Owner state. Every situation looks different from these two positions."

**Candidate?** Usually YES — if something is named as a pair, someone has made a distinction.

---

## Signal 9: Implicit Inversion
**Phrase pattern:** "You'd think X leads to Y, but actually..." / "Everyone assumes X, but I found..." / "Conventional wisdom says X, but the truth is Y"

**What to listen for:**
- Statements that flip common assumptions
- "The thing nobody talks about is..."
- Evidence that contradicts the obvious

**Example:** "People think confidence leads to action. But I've found the opposite: action leads to confidence."

**Candidate?** YES if it's about perception/seeing, not just strategy. The inversion of seeing.

---

## Signal 10: Diagnostic Question
**Phrase pattern:** "Here's how to tell if you're..." / "The question that reveals..." / "If you can answer this, you've got it"

**What to listen for:**
- Questions that separate one perceptual capacity from another
- "How to diagnose whether you're doing X or Y"
- Questions that immediately separate people

**Example:** "Here's how you tell if you're in strategy or tactics: Can you say it in one sentence? If not, you're still in tactics."

**Candidate?** Usually YES — if someone uses a diagnostic question, they've established a distinction.

---

## Signal Combinations

Strong candidates often have multiple signals. For example:

- **Collapse Indicator + Diagnostic Question** = Very likely distinction
- **Explicit Contrast + Named Pair** = Very likely distinction
- **Before/After + Reframing** = Very likely distinction
- **Expert Observation + Breakdown Narrative** = Likely distinction

Weak candidates have only one weak signal or signals that point to information/mechanism rather than distinction.

---

## Non-Signals (What to Ignore)

These are NOT distinction signals:

- **Pure information:** "This tool costs $X" / "Here's the history of Y"
- **Technique/skill:** "Here's how to do X step by step"
- **Advice:** "You should do X more" / "Avoid doing Y"
- **Generic frameworks:** "Here are 5 steps to..."
- **Emotional motivation:** "This will change your life" / "You deserve success"
- **Mechanism only:** Explaining HOW something works without the perceptual shift

---

## Scanning Workflow

When you encounter a signal:

1. **Mark the location** — Line number / page / timestamp
2. **Identify the signal type** — Which of the 10 patterns?
3. **Extract the candidate** — What's the A vs B?
4. **Assess confidence** — High/Medium/Low
5. **Qualify it** — Pass 5+ of the 6 filters?
6. **Flag complications** — Is this actually a mechanism? Information? Framework?
