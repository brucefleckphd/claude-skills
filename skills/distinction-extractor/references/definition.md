# What Is a Distinction — Quick Reference

A distinction is a **perceptual capacity created through language** that permanently alters what you can see — and therefore what you can do.

## Five Properties

1. **Perceptual, not informational** — changes seeing, not knowing
2. **Created in language** — the right words create new perceptual categories
3. **Binary at the core** — A vs Not-A; the boundary IS the distinction
4. **Irreversible once acquired** — like riding a bicycle
5. **Enables action without prescribing it** — shows what's there; you choose what to do

## The Hierarchy

```
DISTINCTIONS (atomic perceptual units)
    → MENTAL MODELS (connected sets)
        → FRAMEWORKS (structured systems)
            → METHODOLOGIES (complete operational systems)
```

## It IS NOT:

- A vocabulary word (knowing the term "leverage" is not a distinction)
- A piece of information (knowing a fact doesn't change your perception)
- A technique or skill (you don't need to DO anything — you need to SEE differently)
- A belief (you don't need to believe in it — you use it like a hammer)
- A framework (frameworks are BUILT from distinctions)

## The Forester Analogy

> "I could walk through a forest today and not see anything. But if tomorrow I walk through that same forest with a forester and they explain how to spot a healthy tree from a sick tree, which trees are great to make fires and which ones are great to live off of, then every walk through that forest from that day forward I would see things that I hadn't seen before. And because I had seen things that I hadn't seen before, I could do things that I hadn't done before." — Rich Schefren

## Key Quotes

> "Distinctions are not definitions or a new form of knowledge. They are tools to create the 'Now I see!' moment." — Djukich

> "Once you get it — like you get a joke — you don't have to think about it. It becomes a part of you." — Djukich

> "The number of distinctions you possess directly determines the number of opportunities you can perceive." — Rich Schefren

> "When you first used a hammer, did you have to believe in it?" — Djukich

## The Qualification Test

To determine whether something IS a genuine distinction, apply these filters:

| Filter | Question | Must Be |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Perceptual** | Does this change what you can SEE (not just what you know)? | Yes |
| **Binary** | Can you express it as A vs Not-A or A vs B? | Yes, at the core |
| **Automatic** | Once acquired, does it work without conscious recall? | Yes |
| **Domain-portable** | Does it reveal things in new situations without re-teaching? | Yes |
| **Action-enabling** | Does it open new action space (not prescribe specific actions)? | Yes |
| **Pre-framework** | Is it atomic (not built from other distinctions)? | Ideally yes |

**Failed examples:**
- "The 4 Ps of Marketing" — this is a framework, not a distinction
- "Revenue was $50K last month" — this is information
- "Use the STAR method for interviews" — this is a technique
- "Trained Incapacity is when expertise becomes a prison" — this is a mechanism

**Passed examples:**
- Healthy tree vs sick tree
- Strategy vs tactics
- Owner vs victim
- Information vs transformation
- Having a problem vs doing a problem
