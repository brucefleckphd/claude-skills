# Expander Evaluation Criteria

Use this framework to evaluate teaching units for quality. Score across six dimensions plus voice check.

## Scoring Scale (1-10)

| 9-10 | Exceptional | Excellent design; ready to ship |
| 7-8 | Good | Minor polish needed |
| 5-6 | Acceptable | Needs rework in specific areas |
| 3-4 | Problematic | Significant design flaws |
| 1-2 | Failed | Does not function as teaching unit |

## Dimension 1: Gap Quality (Weight: 20%)

Does the student feel the absence BEFORE the distinction is named?

### 9-10
Gap strategy is perfectly chosen. Student feels the question/failure/mystery acutely. 60-90 second tension is held. Does NOT preview the answer.

### 7-8
Gap is effective. Student feels the absence. Minor issues with timing or setup.

### 5-6
Gap is present but somewhat weak. Student might not feel the full absence. Or Gap previews too much.

### 3-4
Gap is unclear or doesn't create felt absence. Student doesn't know what they're missing.

### 1-2
No real gap. Distinction is revealed immediately or student doesn't feel the need.

**Key checks:**
- Is the gap strategy appropriate for this distinction type?
- Does the setup create genuine emotional tension?
- Is the expected student state described accurately?
- Does the Gap avoid revealing the distinction?

## Dimension 2: Contrast Sharpness (Weight: 20%)

Is the A vs B clean, binary, and quotable?

### 9-10
Contrast is crisp and binary. No qualifications. A side is in student language. B side is concrete and desirable. Money line is perfect.

### 7-8
Contrast is clear. A/B are distinct. Money line is strong. Minor language polish needed.

### 5-6
Contrast is fuzzy or over-qualified. A/B pairs are not fully binary. Money line is vague.

### 3-4
Contrast is muddled. A/B blur together. Multiple money lines or no clear summary.

### 1-2
Contrast fails to establish clear binary. Student wouldn't remember it.

**Key checks:**
- Is the A side exactly how the student currently thinks?
- Is the B side concrete (not abstract)?
- Is there one clear money line (not multiple)?
- Are there 3 or fewer parallel pairs?
- Would someone repeat this phrase 3 days later?

## Dimension 3: Flash Design (Weight: 20%)

Does it produce the "Now I see!" moment?

### 9-10
Flash is ONE powerful three-act story (or pivot question) with emotional specificity. Student can't help but get it. Backup angle is strong. No announcement of epiphany.

### 7-8
Flash is effective. One story with good detail. Backup angle is useful. Minor polish on emotional specificity.

### 5-6
Flash has multiple examples or lacks emotional detail. Backup angle is weak or missing. Might announce the revelation.

### 3-4
Flash is either too long, too abstract, or attempts multiple stories. Student might understand intellectually but won't have the "now I see" moment.

### 1-2
Flash doesn't produce revelation. Multiple examples or pure conceptual explanation.

**Key checks:**
- Is there ONE primary story (max one backup angle)?
- Does the story have emotional specificity (not just facts)?
- Is the three-act structure clear (setup, wrong answer, reveal)?
- Does it end WITHOUT announcing "See it now?"
- Is Flash length ≤ Gap length?
- Would this story produce sudden silence, not nodding?

## Dimension 4: Name Quality (Weight: 10%)

Is the name memorable, self-explanatory, and portable?

### 9-10
Name is 2-4 words, embeds the contrast, is self-explanatory. Would be used in conversation. Diagnostic question is sharp.

### 7-8
Name is good. Clear and usable. Diagnostic question is useful. Minor polish.

### 5-6
Name is okay but not ideal. Diagnostic question is weak or unclear.

### 3-4
Name is too long, abstract, or forgettable. Diagnostic question doesn't invoke the distinction.

### 1-2
Name is academic, borrowed, or doesn't capture the distinction.

**Key checks:**
- Is it 2-4 words only (not a sentence)?
- Would someone use this in casual conversation (the "bar test")?
- Does the diagnostic question naturally invoke the distinction?
- Is the Name section 15 lines or fewer (no re-teaching)?

---

## Dimension 5: Application Design (Weight: 15%)

Does the 24-hour action drive immediate use?

### 9-10
24-hour action is concrete, produces artifact, applies to student's actual situation. Two follow-up exercises are strong and produce artifacts. All instructions are specific ("Do this" not "Think about").

### 7-8
24-hour action is clear and actionable. Exercises are solid. Minor specificity improvements needed.

### 5-6
24-hour action exists but lacks specificity or clarity. Exercises don't fully produce artifacts. Some "ask yourself" prompts without written output.

### 3-4
24-hour action is vague or abstract. Exercises lack clear artifacts. Multiple thought-based prompts.

### 1-2
No real 24-hour action. Application is purely intellectual.

**Key checks:**
- Does the first action take 5-10 minutes and produce a tangible artifact?
- Is it phrased as "Do this now" (not "Consider" or "Think about")?
- Do both follow-up exercises produce written artifacts (lists, maps, notes)?
- Are self-diagnosis and teach-it exercises specific?
- Are there no pure "ask yourself" prompts?

## Dimension 6: Reinforcement Design (Weight: 15%)

Are daily triggers and peer mechanisms engineered to prevent fade?

### 9-10
Daily trigger is specific and tied to existing behavior. Peer mechanism is distinct to this distinction. Program callback is named specifically. Language signals are clear (before/after pairs). Integration check is behavioral.

### 7-8
Reinforcement has all three elements. Trigger and peer mechanism are clear. Program callback is referenced. Minor specificity improvements.

### 5-6
One or more elements are weak or generic. Peer mechanism is vague ("share with 3 people"). Program callback is not specific.

### 3-4
Reinforcement is mostly speeches with minimal mechanics. Trigger is not specific. Peer mechanism is generic.

### 1-2
Reinforcement is rhetorical (why this matters) with no designed mechanics.

**Key checks:**
- Is the daily trigger tied to something the student encounters every day?
- Is the peer mechanism specific to this distinction (not generic)?
- Is the program callback a specific session/module name?
- Are there 3-5 before/after language signal pairs?
- Is the integration check behavioral (not intellectual)?
- Does reinforcement contain NO rhetorical paragraphs about why it matters?

## Voice Check (+1/0/-1 Modifier)

Does the teaching unit read like YOUR voice?

### +1 (Strong)
Reads exactly like you teaching in a room. Stories, language, pacing all feel natural to your voice. No borrowed terminology. Concrete, direct language. Storytelling is primary.

### 0 (Neutral)
Acceptable voice. Some moments feel like you; some feel generic. Minor terminology issues or explanatory sections.

### -1 (Weak)
Reads like a textbook or neutral teaching voice. Academic language. Explanatory sections dominate. Doesn't sound like you.

**Key checks:**
- Does the language match your pattern markers?
- Are there academic or borrowed terms (antifragile, paradigm, optimize)?
- Is the story-to-explanation ratio correct (more stories, fewer explanations)?
- Would you say this phrase while teaching in a room?

## Constraint Violations (Auto-REVISE)

**Any violation of C1-C10 = automatic REVISE regardless of score.**

Check:
- [ ] C1: Flash length ≤ Gap length, one primary story max
- [ ] C2: Flash uses three-act or pivot question structure
- [ ] C3: No five-example cascades in Flash
- [ ] C4: Contrast has 3 pairs max
- [ ] C5: Application opens with 24-hour action
- [ ] C6: All exercises produce artifacts
- [ ] C7: Reinforcement has daily trigger, peer, program callback
- [ ] C8: Name section is 15 lines or less
- [ ] C9: Total unit is 250-350 lines
- [ ] C10: No borrowed terminology

---

## Verdict Logic

**SHIP (8.0+ adjusted)** — Teaching unit is production-ready.

**REVISE (below 8.0)** — Specific sections need improvement. List required revisions.

**Note:** Constraint violations override score. Even a 9.0 unit with a C-violation must REVISE.
