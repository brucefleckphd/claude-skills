# Distinction Types — Quick Reference

## Type 1: Collapsed
Two different things treated as the same. Uncollapsing creates action space.
- **Signal:** "People confuse X with Y" / Same word, two meanings
- **Delivery key:** Show the COST of the collapse
- **Examples:** Freedom vs Relief, Strategy vs Tactics, Understanding vs Learning

## Type 2: Perceptual
A new category that doesn't exist in the person's perceptual field.
- **Signal:** Expert sees something novice doesn't
- **Delivery key:** Name it so they see it everywhere
- **Examples:** Healthy vs sick tree, Stack layers, Owner vs Victim

## Type 3: Inversion
A common assumption that's exactly backwards.
- **Signal:** "Everyone thinks X leads to Y" but X prevents Y
- **Delivery key:** Shock with the flip
- **Examples:** "Information is what's missing" (it's not — transformation is), "Confidence leads to action" (action leads to confidence)

## Type 4: Domain-Transfer
Expert distinction from one domain applied to another.
- **Signal:** Expert domain maps perfectly to student's domain
- **Delivery key:** Make the analogy collapse into identity
- **Examples:** Architecture → AI leadership, Military force multiplier → Business AI

## Type 5: Stance
A distinction about WHERE you operate from, not what you do.
- **Signal:** Same situation, radically different results based on inner position
- **Delivery key:** Confront the current stance
- **Examples:** Overwhelmed vs Focused, Trying vs Committed, "How to" vs "Choose to"

## Type 6: Structural
A distinction about how things connect — architecture, not content.
- **Signal:** Person sees pieces but misses the system
- **Delivery key:** Zoom out until the pattern appears
- **Examples:** Tool use vs System architecture, Tasks vs Pipelines, People vs Roles
