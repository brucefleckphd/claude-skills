# The Landing Sequence — Quick Reference (v2.0)

Six steps, in order. Skip none.

## Step 1: THE GAP (Setup)
Create the felt absence BEFORE naming the distinction.

**Three strategies:**
- **Unanswerable Question** — Ask something requiring the distinction to answer
- **Recognized Failure** — "Have you ever done X and gotten a result you didn't expect?"
- **Expert Mystery** — "What does that person see that you don't?"

**Timing rule:** Do NOT reveal the distinction in the Gap. Hold the tension for 60-90 seconds. If the Gap previews the answer, the Contrast loses its edge. The student should commit to the wrong answer before you show them why it's wrong.

**Output:** Script of what you would say. Expected student state after.

## Step 2: THE CONTRAST (Core)
A vs B, binary, no nuance, no qualifications. **Maximum 3 parallel pairs + summation.**

**Rules:**
- A side = student's current language
- B side = concrete, visualizable
- "Money line" = one sentence capturing the contrast — quotable, portable
- 3 pairs maximum. Pattern is obvious after 2; 3rd confirms. Extra pairs → Application.

## Step 3: THE FLASH (The Moment)
The "Now I see!" moment. **ONE story, not a chapter.** Cannot be forced — only set up.

**Default: Three-Act Story**
- Act 1: Setup — the situation
- Act 2: Student's instinct plays out (wrong) — they identify with this
- Act 3: Reveal — their instinct was the actual problem

**Alternative: Pivot Question** (when artifact exists)
- Show the artifact → Ask the question → Student's own answer IS the flash

**Backup:** ONE alternate angle (5-7 lines) for students the primary misses.

**BANNED:** Five-example cascades. If you have 5 examples, you have 4 too many for Flash. Put the extras in Application.

**Self-check:** If Flash ends with "See it now?" or "Welcome to the other side" — delete it. Announced epiphanies aren't epiphanies.

**Signs it landed:** Sudden silence, laughter, "oh shit," immediate self-example
**Signs it didn't:** Nodding, note-taking, "that makes sense," moving on without pause

## Step 4: THE NAME (Anchor)
Give it a name IMMEDIATELY after the flash. **15 lines maximum.**

**Rules:** 2-4 words, embeds contrast, self-explanatory, usable in conversation
**Pattern:** "That's a [Name] situation" / "Are you doing [A] or [B]?"
**Bar test:** Would someone use this phrase 3 beers into a conversation?

Do NOT re-teach the distinction in the Name section. Label it and move on.

## Step 5: THE APPLICATION (Cement)
**FIRST:** 24-hour action — concrete, 5-10 minutes, produces artifact. "Do this now, before you continue."

**THEN:** Two moves:
1. **Self-Diagnosis** — Where in YOUR business are you on the wrong side? (produces a written list)
2. **Teach It** — Explain to a partner. Teaching = strongest consolidation. Include quality check.

**Rule:** Every exercise produces an artifact (list, map, template). No "ask yourself" prompts without written output.

## Step 6: THE REINFORCEMENT (Prevent Fade)
No speeches. Only designed mechanics.

- **Daily trigger** — tied to existing behavior (task list, inbox, calendar). Fires every day whether or not something breaks.
- **Peer mechanism** — specific to THIS distinction's conversational entry point. Not generic "share with 3 people."
- **Program callback** — specific session/module where distinction resurfaces under pressure
- **Language signals** — 3-5 before/after phrase pairs
- **Integration check (30 days)** — behavioral questions that can't be faked with intellect

**BANNED:** Rhetorical paragraphs about why the distinction matters. The Flash made the case. Reinforcement engineers contact, not argument.
