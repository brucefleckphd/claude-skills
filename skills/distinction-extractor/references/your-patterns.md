# Your Voice Patterns — CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE

The Distinction Expander uses these patterns to match teaching units to YOUR voice. Fill this in completely before expanding your first distinction.

## Teaching Entry Patterns

How do you typically introduce new ideas? Check all that apply:

- [ ] I start with a story or personal experience
- [ ] I ask provocative questions first
- [ ] I demonstrate or show the concept in action
- [ ] I reference specific situations my students are in
- [ ] I use contrasts or binary framings
- [ ] I reference obstacles or breakdowns first
- [ ] I use specific people/clients as examples

**Describe your typical opening approach:**

[Write 2-3 sentences about how you usually introduce something new]

## Distinctive Elements

What's unique about how YOU teach?

**Your signature move (something you do consistently):**
[e.g., "I always ask students to apply it to their specific situation before moving on"]

**Your main value-add (why students get it from you vs. someone else):**
[e.g., "I ground everything in real business scenarios"]

**Your audience's main result (what they come away saying):**
[e.g., "That was so practical, I can use it tomorrow"]

## Example Pattern

(This shows what a filled-in version looks like — adapt for your own patterns)

**Teaching Entry:** I start by showing a breakdown or moment of confusion my students have experienced. I name the situation specifically so they recognize themselves. THEN I ask a question that makes them realize they're missing something. The gap is felt before I name anything.

**Catchphrases:** "Here's what happens...", "The thing people miss...", "That's actually backwards..."

**Tone:** Direct and blunt. Warm underneath but not fluffy. Provocative — I name the thing people are avoiding.

**Story style:** Short stories about mistakes and specific client situations. I always include what I was thinking at the time (emotional specificity). Usually 2-3 minute stories, not long narratives.

**Register:** Conversational, real-world language. No corporate speak. I use "breakdown" instead of "challenge," "seeing" instead of "realizing," "stalled" instead of "plateaued."

**Anti-patterns:** I never use "leverage," "paradigm," or "optimize." I avoid five-example cascades. I don't do abstract philosophy. I won't reference other people's frameworks without tying them to a real situation.

**Signature move:** I always end teaching with "Now go find where you're doing this," and give them 5 minutes to name one specific situation from their own business.

**Value-add:** I make it immediately actionable. Students know what to do differently by the time I'm done. No "something to think about" — "something to do now."

**Result they report:** "I finally understand that thing I've been doing wrong, and I know how to fix it."
