## Core Delivery Philosophy (Tier 1)

### D1. Always About Them Principle
**Tier:** 1
**Core Focus:** Universal filter for all presentation and delivery decisions
**When to Use:** Every decision about recording, editing, technical setup, presentation style
**Key Insight:** Not about your technical perfection or comfort. About what helps THEM learn and trust faster. Camera on/off? Fancy graphics? Perfect recording? Filter every choice through "does this serve THEM?"

### D2. Hybrid Webinar Method
**Tier:** 1
**Core Focus:** Pre-recorded presentation (Phases 1-4) + Live Q&A and close (Phase 5)
**When to Use:** Deciding webinar delivery model, optimizing for conversion and efficiency
**Key Insight:** Beats fully automated (no trust) AND fully live (exhausting, tech risks). Perfect your teaching once, build trust live. Best conversion rates while staying sustainable. Kern's proven method.

## Recording & Editing (Tier 3-4)

### D3. Keynote Alternative for Camera-Shy Presenters
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Screen recording with slides and voiceover only, no camera
**When to Use:** If uncomfortable on camera or want to test before investing in camera setup
**Key Insight:** Kern's simple-slide webinar with no camera: $140K from 1,500 attendees ($100/attendee). Camera optional. Clear teaching beats production value. Test this first.

### D4. ScreenFlow Recording and Editing Basics
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** Primary tool for Mac screen recording, editing, and exporting
**When to Use:** Recording presentations, editing out mistakes, preparing final videos

### D5. Recording Mistake Recovery Method
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** Fix errors without full re-record
**When to Use:** During recording when you make mistakes
**Key Insight:** Small mistake: pause 3 sec, repeat correctly, edit out. Big mistake: pause 5 sec, restart slide section, edit out. Never restart entire presentation. Mistakes are normal, recovery is system.

### D6. Wistia Autoplay and Controls Configuration
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** Video player settings for different use cases
**When to Use:** Embedding videos in registration, thank you, or sales pages
**Key Insight:** Autoplay ON for indoctrination/thank you (they're committed). Controls: show play/pause/volume, hide timeline scrubbing on VSLs (prevents skipping), show fullscreen option.

## Technical Setup (Tier 3-4)

### D7. Soundflower Setup for Mac Audio Broadcasting
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** Route Mac audio output to webinar platform input
**When to Use:** Hybrid webinar where you need to broadcast pre-recorded video audio through live platform
**Key Insight:** Allows playing pre-recorded presentation through GoToWebinar/Zoom so attendees hear video audio. System Prefs → Sound → Output → Soundflower. Webinar input → Soundflower. Switch to mic for live Q&A.

### D8. Pre-Webinar Test Run Protocol
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Critical checks 30 minutes before going live
**When to Use:** Before every webinar to prevent technical disasters
**Key Insight:** Test with assistant: pre-recorded audio plays, Soundflower routes correctly, mic works for live, platform recording on, slides advance, registration/thank you pages live. 30 min prevents last-second panic.

### D9. 'So If You' Language Pattern
**Tier:** 3
**Core Focus:** Natural conversational flow pattern throughout presentation
**When to Use:** Transitioning between points, setting up next section, creating natural flow
**Key Insight:** "So if you want [result]..." or "So if you're struggling with [problem]..." Creates conversational tone, includes audience, sets up next point naturally. Kern's signature speaking style.

## Background Context (Tier 4)

### D10. Kern's Video Discovery Origin Story
**Tier:** 4
**Core Focus:** How Frank discovered the power of video in marketing
**When to Use:** Understanding why Kern emphasizes video so heavily
**Key Insight:** Early internet marketer who discovered video converts dramatically higher than text. Built philosophy around "show, don't tell" and "demonstrate, don't claim." Led to hybrid method and tutorial-over-hype approach.
