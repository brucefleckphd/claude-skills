## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Model** - Use D2 (Hybrid Method) to understand pre-recorded + live approach
2. **Setup Tools** - Use D4 (ScreenFlow) and D7 (Soundflower) for recording infrastructure
3. **Record Presentation** - Use D3 (Keynote Alternative) if camera-shy, D5 for mistake recovery
4. **Configure Playback** - Use D6 (Wistia) for video player settings
5. **Test Before Live** - Use D8 (Test Run Protocol) to prevent technical disasters
6. **Throughout** - Use D1 (Always About Them) as constant filter

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Core Delivery Principle

**Hybrid beats fully automated OR fully live:**

```
FULLY AUTOMATED               HYBRID METHOD ✓               FULLY LIVE
Pre-recorded everything       Pre-recorded presentation     Everything live
+ Perfect presentation        + Perfect presentation        + Live energy
+ No tech issues             + Live Q&A builds trust       + Can adapt on fly
- No live connection         + Best conversion rates       - Tech issues
- Lower conversion           + Repeatable                  - One mistake ruins it
                            + Can be improved             - Exhausting to repeat

HYBRID STRUCTURE:
Phase 1-4 (Pre-recorded):     Phase 5 (Live):
- Confirmation                - Answer questions
- Difference                  - Address objections
- Bond                        - Close with urgency
- Payoff                      - Build trust through interaction

PHILOSOPHY: Perfect your teaching once. Build trust live.
```

## The Recording Setup

### Tools You Need
- **ScreenFlow** (Mac) - Record screen + audio + camera (optional)
- **Keynote or PowerPoint** - Slides (or use alternative below)
- **Soundflower** (Mac) - Route audio if using webinar platform during hybrid
- **Wistia** - Host videos with autoplay control

### For Camera-Shy Presenters
**Keynote Alternative:**
- Create slides with text/bullets
- Record screen showing slides
- Voiceover only, no face on camera
- Still highly effective ($100/attendee proven)
- Test this first before investing in camera setup

### Recording Process
1. Set up slides
2. Configure ScreenFlow to record screen + audio
3. Hit record, deliver presentation
4. Use mistake recovery (see D5) for errors
5. Edit in ScreenFlow (minimal cuts only)
6. Export and upload to Wistia

## Hybrid Method Implementation

### Pre-Recorded (Phases 1-4)
**Why pre-record:**
- Perfect it once, use many times
- No live tech failures during teaching
- Can edit out mistakes
- Professional quality guaranteed
- You're not exhausted after 100 webinars

**What to pre-record:**
- Confirmation (5 min)
- Difference (5 min)
- Bond story (10 min)
- Payoff teaching (30-40 min)

### Live Portion (Phase 5)
**Why go live:**
- Builds trust (they know you're real)
- Answer specific questions
- Handle objections in real-time
- Create urgency and scarcity
- Higher conversion than 100% automated

**What to do live:**
- Q&A session
- Address common objections
- Make the offer
- Create time pressure
- Confirm purchases

## Audio Broadcasting Setup (Mac)

### Soundflower Configuration
**Problem:** Need to broadcast pre-recorded video audio through webinar platform
**Solution:** Soundflower routes Mac audio to webinar software

**Setup:**
1. Install Soundflower
2. System Preferences → Sound → Output → Soundflower (2ch)
3. Webinar platform (GTW, Zoom) → Audio input → Soundflower
4. Play pre-recorded video, audience hears it through webinar
5. Switch back to microphone for live Q&A

**Use when:** Playing pre-recorded presentation in hybrid webinar

## Pre-Webinar Test Run Protocol

### Critical Checks (30 min before)
- [ ] Pre-recorded video loads and plays
- [ ] Audio routing works (Soundflower configured)
- [ ] Slides advance properly
- [ ] Microphone works for live portion
- [ ] Webinar platform recording is on
- [ ] Registration page is live
- [ ] Thank you page/liquidator is live
- [ ] Email reminders sent
- [ ] Countdown timer works (if using)

### Test with Assistant
- Have someone join as attendee
- Verify they can hear pre-recorded audio
- Verify they can hear you live
- Test Q&A functionality
- Confirm chat/questions work

## Mistake Recovery Method

### During Recording
**Small mistake (stumble, wrong word):**
- Pause 3 seconds
- Repeat sentence correctly
- Edit out mistake in ScreenFlow

**Big mistake (wrong info, lost place):**
- Pause 5 seconds
- Say "Let me restart this section"
- Go back to beginning of current slide
- Edit out entire mistake section

**Don't:**
- Stop and restart entire presentation
- Get frustrated on camera
- Apologize profusely (edit it out anyway)

## The Language Pattern

### 'So If You' Pattern
**Purpose:** Natural conversational flow
**Usage:** Throughout presentation

**Examples:**
- "So if you want to [desired result]..."
- "So if you're serious about [goal]..."
- "So if you've been struggling with [problem]..."

**Why it works:**
- Conversational, not formal
- Includes them in the statement
- Sets up next point naturally
- Kern's natural speaking style

## Wistia Configuration

### Autoplay Settings
- **Indoctrination videos:** Autoplay ON (they're committed, let it play)
- **Thank you page video:** Autoplay ON (already registered)
- **Sales page video:** User preference (test both)

### Controls
- Show play/pause
- Show volume
- Hide timeline scrubbing (for VSLs - keep them from skipping)
- Show fullscreen option

## Common Technical Issues

### "My audio sounds terrible"
- Check microphone quality (invest $50-100 minimum)
- Record in quiet room
- Use ScreenFlow audio filters

### "Soundflower not working"
- Restart Mac after installing
- Check System Preferences → Sound → Output
- Verify webinar platform input source

### "Video file too large"
- ScreenFlow export settings: 720p, H.264, Medium quality
- Wistia compresses automatically
- 60-90 min webinar = ~500MB-1GB

### "Slides look blurry"
- Record at actual screen resolution
- Export at 720p minimum
- Use vector graphics in Keynote, not rasterized images

## Always About Them Principle (Applied to Delivery)

**Every delivery decision filtered through: "Is this about them?"**

- Camera on or off? → Whatever makes THEM more comfortable learning
- Fancy graphics or simple? → Whatever helps THEM understand faster
- Perfect recording or good enough? → Get it to THEM sooner
- Live or automated? → What builds THEIR trust more?

**Philosophy:** Technical perfection is about YOU. Clear teaching is about THEM.
