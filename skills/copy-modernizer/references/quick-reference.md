## The 12 Modern Copy Principles Checklist

Use this as a quality gate before and after modernization:

- [ ] **P1: Person talking** -- Read it aloud. Does it sound conversational?
- [ ] **P2: Earn your place** -- Could I delete this sentence? If not, it's earned.
- [ ] **P3: Specificity** -- Are there exact numbers, names, real timelines?
- [ ] **P4: Admit what's hard** -- Does copy acknowledge at least one struggle/limitation?
- [ ] **P5: One idea/paragraph** -- No paragraph has two unrelated points?
- [ ] **P6: Bold not CAPS** -- Any ALL CAPS? Replace with **bold** or stronger word.
- [ ] **P7: Real urgency** -- Is every deadline tied to real business constraint?
- [ ] **P8: CTA = instructions** -- CTAs tell them exactly what happens next, step-by-step?
- [ ] **P9: Proof through process** -- Does proof show HOW, not just THAT?
- [ ] **P10: Anti-hype** -- Does copy actively reject at least one inflated promise?
- [ ] **P11: One story, one point** -- Is any story over 200 words or making 2+ points?
- [ ] **P12: Two reading speeds** -- Does skim path (H1, bold, bullets, CTA) tell complete story?

## The 7 Shift Dimensions: Quick Assessment

Rate each on 1-5 scale (5 = fully modern):

### D1: Urgency
**Dated signals:** Countdown timers, "last chance ever", artificial scarcity
**Modern position:** Real enrollment windows, genuine capacity limits, opportunity cost math
**Fix:** Replace manufactured deadlines with real reasons

### D2: Proof
**Dated signals:** Vague testimonials, testimonial walls, "PROOF THAT..."
**Modern position:** Named case studies, execution proof, mechanism explanation
**Fix:** Replace quantity with quality; show process, not just outcomes

### D3: CTAs
**Dated signals:** "ACT NOW!", "CLAIM YOUR SPOT!", all-caps buttons
**Modern position:** Outcome-focused instructions, calm walkthrough
**Fix:** Rewrite as step-by-step instructions; use benefit-oriented button text

### D4: Headlines
**Dated signals:** ALL CAPS, curiosity-gap vagueness, rhetorical questions
**Modern position:** Specific + benefit-forward, with supporting subhead
**Fix:** State the thing; let word choice carry weight

### D5: Objections
**Dated signals:** Confrontational ("doubters never succeed"), dismissive tone
**Modern position:** Empathetic specificity, name-concede-redirect structure
**Fix:** Acknowledge the valid concern first, then show why core value holds

### D6: Rhythm
**Dated signals:** Dense paragraphs (5+ sentences), relentless density
**Modern position:** 1-3 sentences per paragraph, strategic white space
**Fix:** Break paragraphs; add subheads every 200-300 words

### D7: Tone
**Dated signals:** Aggressive seller voice, manufactured enthusiasm
**Modern position:** Knowledgeable advisor, earned confidence
**Fix:** Replace "you should" with "here's what I found"

## Hormozi Voice: 10 Key Rules

### 1. Third-Grade Words
Replace formal vocabulary:
- "Implement" → "do"
- "Leverage" → "use"
- "Generate leads" → "get people who want to buy"

### 2. Short/Long Cadence
Pattern: Short. Short. Long with story. Short that lands.

### 3. Specific Numbers
- "$50K" → "$47,000"
- "Many years" → "13 years"
- If no number exists, remove the vague claim

### 4. Kill Formal Transitions
- "Furthermore" → "And so."
- "However" → "But here's the thing."
- "In conclusion" → "Big picture."

### 5. Name Objections First
Structure: Name it. Concede the valid part. Redirect to why core value holds.

### 6. Urgency Through Math
- Replace: "This offer expires" → "Every month you don't do this costs you $X"
- Remove countdown timers

### 7. Short Stories (Max 200 Words)
- One point per story
- Add specific sensory details
- Cut stories with no strategic purpose

### 8. Undercut Hype
- "Most powerful system" → "Best one I've found"
- Add self-deprecating qualifier
- At least one anti-hype per page

### 9. CTA = Calm Instructions
- Remove: caps, exclamation points, urgency language
- "ACT NOW!" → "Here's what to do next"

### 10. Let Strong Statements Breathe
- After strong claim/insight, add paragraph break
- Create one-sentence paragraphs
- Remove unnecessary explanation after landed statement

## Pre/Post Modernization Checklist

**Before modernization:**
- [ ] Read the entire copy understanding strategic intent
- [ ] Note all proof points (must survive)
- [ ] Identify objections being handled (must survive)
- [ ] Map belief shifts (must survive)
- [ ] Note story beats (must survive)

**After modernization:**
- [ ] All proof intact? (just repackaged)
- [ ] All objections handled? (just more empathetically)
- [ ] All stories preserved? (just modernized)
- [ ] Core argument unchanged?
- [ ] Skim path (H1 > bold > bullets > CTA) tells complete story?
- [ ] Pass 12 Principles checklist?
- [ ] Scores improved on 7 Dimensions?

## Output Format Expectation

When you run a modernizer skill, expect:

**Section A: Modernized Copy**
Ready to use, full version.

**Section B: Change Log**
| Line | Original | Modernized | Rule/Dimension | Reason |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|

**Section C: Scores**
Before/after ratings on 7 Dimensions (1-5 scale) + Principles checklist

**Section D: Remaining Issues**
Anything still needing manual work, with specific recommendations.

## Key Principle: Preserve Architecture, Update Language

This is the golden rule of copy modernization:

```
✓ DO: Update SURFACE LAYER
  - Word choices
  - Formatting
  - Tone markers
  - Delivery style
  - Language register

✗ DON'T: Change STRATEGIC LAYER
  - Proof points
  - Belief shifts
  - Objection handling
  - Core argument
  - Offer structure
  - Story narratives
```

The arena got the architecture right. You're just making it sound 2026, not 2010.
