# Copy Modernizer: Master Orchestrator

Transforms any direct response copy from "sounds like 2010" to "sounds like 2026" -- without gutting the strategic architecture. This is the master skill that coordinates four specialized modernization approaches:

1. **Contrast** -- Surgical pattern replacement (86 specific rules across 16 copy categories)
2. **Current** -- Dimension analysis (7 shift dimensions + 12 modern principles)
3. **Hormozi** -- Voice transformation (16 voice rules + vocabulary swaps)
4. **All** -- Three-pass pipeline combining all approaches with conflict resolution

## When to Use

- After the copywriting arena produces a draft
- When reviewing any direct response copy that feels "2005-2015"
- When copy sounds like an infomercial (ALL CAPS, "ACT NOW!", fake urgency)
- As a final pass before publishing any sales copy
- When you're not sure which modernization level to apply

## What It Does

1. Accepts copy input (pasted text or file path)
2. Runs one or more modernization passes depending on your needs
3. Preserves the strategic/architectural layer (proof structure, objection handling, belief shifts)
4. Outputs modernized version + detailed change log + scores
5. Identifies any remaining issues that need manual attention

## What It Does NOT Do

- Rewrite the strategic argument or offer positioning
- Change the core persuasion architecture
- Remove urgency entirely (replaces manufactured urgency with authentic urgency)
- Clone any single voice (applies modern patterns, not voice-matching)
- Dumb down or shorten copy unnecessarily

## Quick Start

```
/copy-modernizer
```

Then choose which approach you want, or I'll recommend one based on your copy's current state.

## The Four Approaches

### Approach 1: Modernize-Contrast (Surgical -- Safest)

**Use when:** You want minimal changes, only targeting specific dated patterns.

Scans your copy against 86 find-and-replace rules across 16 categories:
- Headlines (H1-H8)
- Leads (L1-L8)
- Body copy (B1-B14)
- Urgency (U1-U8)
- CTAs (C1-C8)
- Proof (P1-P7)
- Formatting (F1-F6)
- Bullets (BL1-BL7)
- Rhetorical patterns (R1-R6)
- Tone (T1-T8)
- Email patterns (E1-E5)
- Guarantee language (GU1-GU4)
- VSL patterns (V1-V4)
- Story/narrative (S1-S4)
- Objection handling (O1-O5)
- Offer presentation (OP1-OP4)

**Output:** Original copy with specific patterns replaced + change log + quality verification

---

### Approach 2: Modernize-Current (Comprehensive)

**Use when:** You want modern-sounding results across all dimensions.

Analyzes your copy against:
- **7 Shift Dimensions:** Urgency, Proof, CTAs, Headlines, Objections, Rhythm, Tone
- **12 Modern Copy Principles:** The shared patterns of all high-converting copy (2024-2026)

Scores each dimension (1-5 scale) and rewrites anything below 3/5 to meet modern standards.

**Output:** Modernized copy + dimension scores (before/after) + change log + principles check + remaining issues

---

### Approach 3: Modernize-Hormozi (Voice-Specific)

**Use when:** Your audience knows Hormozi or you want his specific voice (short sentences, third-grade words, math-based urgency).

Applies 16 voice rules extracted from 471 video transcripts (2.5M+ words):
- Third-grade vocabulary replacement
- Short/long sentence alternation
- Formal transition elimination
- Adverb elimination
- Active voice conversion
- Specific number emphasis
- Calm instruction CTAs
- Anti-hype statements
- Strategic white space

**Important:** This is optional. Works best for business/coaching audiences. Skip if your brand doesn't align with Hormozi's register.

**Output:** Hormozi-voiced copy + voice score (before/after) + change log

---

### Approach 4: Modernize-All (Most Comprehensive)

**Use when:** You want the most thorough modernization possible.

Runs three sequential passes with conflict resolution:

1. **Pass 1: Contrast** -- Apply 86 surgical replacement rules
2. **Pass 2: Current** -- Analyze 7 dimensions + verify 12 principles
3. **Pass 3: Hormozi (optional)** -- Apply voice rules if audience fits

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If Contrast and Current disagree: Current wins (broader pattern beats specific rule)
- If Current and Hormozi disagree: Current wins (general modern beats single voice)
- All three preserve strategic architecture (proof points, belief shifts, offer structure)

**Output:** Fully modernized copy + multi-pass change log + dimension scores + voice scores + remaining issues

## Which Approach Should I Use?

| Your Situation | Use This | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Just want to clean up obvious dated patterns | `/modernize-contrast` | Surgical, conservative, fastest |
| Want the most modern-sounding result | `/modernize-current` | Thorough dimension-based analysis |
| Writing for a Hormozi-style audience | `/modernize-hormozi` | Specific voice transformation |
| Want maximum modernization | `/modernize-all` | All three approaches combined |
| Not sure where to start | `/modernize-all` | Handles everything, resolves conflicts |

---

## What You Get Back

**Section A: Modernized Copy**
Full rewritten version, ready to use.

**Section B: Change Log**
Every change with:
- Original text
- Modernized replacement
- Rule ID or dimension reference
- Reasoning

**Section C: Scores**
- Before/after dimension scores (1-5 scale)
- Principles checklist (before/after pass/fail)
- Voice scores if Hormozi was applied

**Section D: Remaining Issues**
Any elements that still need manual work, with specific recommendations.

## Key Principles

### The 12 Modern Copy Principles

Every modernized piece of copy must pass these:

1. **Sound like a person talking, not a copywriter writing** -- Would you say this to a friend?
2. **Every sentence earns its place** -- Does removing it lose proof, clarity, or emotion?
3. **Specificity as credibility** -- Exact numbers, named people, real timelines
4. **Admit what's hard, limited, or failed** -- Acknowledge at least one struggle
5. **One idea per paragraph, max 3 lines on mobile** -- No two unrelated points together
6. **Bold for emphasis, not CAPS** -- Replace ALL CAPS with bold or stronger word choice
7. **Real urgency only** -- Every deadline tied to genuine business constraint
8. **CTA = instructions, not commands** -- Tell them step-by-step what happens next
9. **Proof through process, not just outcomes** -- Show HOW the result was achieved
10. **Anti-hype as trust signal** -- Actively reject at least one inflated promise
11. **One story, one point, under 200 words** -- No multi-purpose or bloated stories
12. **Designed for two reading speeds** -- Skim path (headline > bold > bullets > CTA) tells complete story

### The 7 Shift Dimensions

**D1: Urgency**
- Dated: Manufactured deadlines, artificial scarcity, fake countdowns
- Modern: Real enrollment windows, genuine capacity limits, opportunity cost framing

**D2: Proof**
- Dated: Testimonial stacking (quantity over quality)
- Modern: Execution proof (case studies, process docs, mechanism explanation)

**D3: CTAs**
- Dated: Commands ("ACT NOW!", "CLAIM YOUR SPOT")
- Modern: Outcome-focused instructions ("Get the Framework", "Start the Assessment")

**D4: Headlines**
- Dated: Dense, curiosity-withholding, ALL CAPS, announcement-style
- Modern: Specific, benefit-forward, story-led, with supporting subheading

**D5: Objection Handling**
- Dated: Confrontational ("doubters never succeed", "skeptics miss out")
- Modern: Empathetic specificity ("what specifically concerns you?")

**D6: Rhythm**
- Dated: Relentless density, every sentence packed
- Modern: Strategic pauses, breathing room, white space

**D7: Tone**
- Dated: Aggressive seller ("This is too good to pass up!")
- Modern: Knowledgeable advisor ("Here's what I found after testing this")

## Common Patterns Changed

### Headlines

| All CAPS emphasis | **Bold** or stronger word choice |

### Leads

### Urgency
| Dated Pattern | Modern Version |
|---|---|
| "WARNING: Slots Fill Fast -- Click Below Now" | "Early-bird pricing ends January 31 -- $497 after that" |

## Quality Checks

After modernization, verify:

✓ No ALL CAPS emphasis (except brand names/acronyms)
✓ No "LIES." / "WRONG." / "BULL." standalone sentences
✓ No "Group A / Group B" binaries
✓ No "ACT NOW" / "RIGHT NOW" urgency commands
✓ No multiple P.S. sections
✓ Skim path (headlines + bold + bullets) tells complete story
✓ Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max
✓ Strategic argument fully preserved
✓ Every proof point and objection handling intact
✓ Sounds like a person talking, not a copywriter writing

## Arena Context

This system was built by analyzing arena output from:
- Black Friday Profit System (Clayton, Evaldo, Deutsch, Carlton)
- CEO Performance Institute (Clayton, Carlton, Deutsch, Evaldo)
- AI Execution Engine (Carlton-primary synthesis)

The arena's strategic/architectural layer is strong. The language/surface layer is where modernization happens. This skill preserves architecture while updating surface language.
