# Cage Positioning Layer

## What This Layer Covers

The Positioning Layer is where you frame the conversation. After understanding what your audience wants (Foundation), you now position yourself as the guide who can help them get it.

**Two frameworks:**
1. **Title Alchemy** (Tier 2 - King) - Magnetic title creation system
2. **Authority Architecture** (Tier 2 - King) - Credibility without ego framework

**Core principle:** Positioning serves the audience, not your ego. It answers two questions:
- "Is this for me?" (Title)
- "Why should I listen to you?" (Authority)

## When to Use This Skill

Use the Positioning layer when:

- You've completed Foundation (Desire Tap + X-Ray)
- You need to craft a compelling title/headline
- You're establishing credibility for a presentation
- Your current positioning isn't resonating
- Testing new angles or hooks
- Entering a new market with existing offer

**Prerequisites:** Foundation must be complete. You cannot craft an effective title without knowing the Desire Tap.

## The Two Frameworks

### 1. Title Alchemy (Creating Magnetic Titles)

**What it is:** Formula-based system for crafting titles that tap desire and promise transformation.

**Core formulas:**
- "How to [GET WHAT THEY WANT] without [WHAT THEY FEAR]"
- "The [CONTRARIAN APPROACH] to [DESIRED OUTCOME]"
- "[NUMBER] [UNEXPECTED THING] that [DESIRED RESULT]"
- "Why [BELIEF THEY HOLD] is [WRONG/INCOMPLETE] and what to do instead"

**Why this matters:** The title is your first Desire Tap. If it doesn't resonate, they won't show up.

### 2. Authority Architecture (Building Credibility)

**What it is:** System for establishing credibility without ego, arrogance, or over-credentialing.

**Three authority types:**
- **Experience authority:** "I've done it"
- **Result authority:** "I've helped others do it"
- **Research authority:** "I've studied it deeply"

**Key principle:** Authority serves the audience, not the speaker. It answers "Why should I listen to you?" not "Aren't I impressive?"

**Why this matters:** Without authority, they won't trust your guidance. With too much, they'll feel distance.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Review Your Foundation
Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Desire Tap identified (one sentence)
- [ ] X-Ray Question 2 answered (what they REALLY want)
- [ ] X-Ray Question 8 completed (language they use)
- [ ] X-Ray Question 5 answered (what they believe)

These inform your positioning.

### Step 2: Craft Your Title Using Title Alchemy

**Process:**

1. **Extract key elements from Foundation:**
   - Desire Tap (what they want)
   - X-Ray Q7 (what they fear)
   - X-Ray Q5 (beliefs they hold)
   - X-Ray Q8 (language they use)

2. **Generate 10-20 title options** using the formulas:

   **Formula 1: How to [WANT] without [FEAR]**
   - Example: "How to Build a 6-Figure Business Without Quitting Your Day Job"

   **Formula 2: The [CONTRARIAN] to [OUTCOME]**
   - Example: "The Anti-Hustle Approach to Doubling Your Income"

   **Formula 3: [NUMBER] [UNEXPECTED] that [RESULT]**
   - Example: "3 Lazy Habits that Generate Passive Income"

   **Formula 4: Why [BELIEF] is [WRONG] and what to do instead**
   - Example: "Why 'Follow Your Passion' is Terrible Career Advice (And What Actually Works)"

3. **Test each title against criteria:**
   - Does it tap the Desire (not create new desire)?
   - Does it use their language (X-Ray Q8)?
   - Does it address a fear or belief (X-Ray Q5 or Q7)?
   - Does it promise transformation?
   - Would they say "That's exactly what I want"?

4. **Select the strongest** (or combine elements from multiple)

### Step 3: Build Your Authority Architecture

**Process:**

1. **Identify which authority type fits:**
   - Review X-Ray Question 5: What do they believe?
   - What kind of authority will they respect?

   **Example:**
   - If they believe "you need credentials" → Research authority
   - If they believe "you need proof it works" → Result authority
   - If they believe "you need to have done it yourself" → Experience authority

2. **Draft authority statement (2-3 sentences):**

   **Template for Experience Authority:**
   "I [did the thing they want to do] and [achieved result]. I've been doing this for [time period] and have [specific metric/outcome]."

   **Template for Result Authority:**
   "I've helped [number] [type of people] [achieve desired outcome]. My clients/students have [specific results]."

   **Template for Research Authority:**
   "I've spent [time period] studying [topic] and have [analyzed/tested/researched] [specific thing]. I've [published/taught/documented] [specific work]."

3. **Test authority statement:**
   - Does it build trust without ego?
   - Does it answer "Why you?"
   - Does it feel like service, not bragging?
   - Is it specific (not generic)?
   - Would they believe you can help them?

### Step 4: Test Positioning Integration

**Title + Authority should work together:**

- Title taps the desire
- Authority establishes you can help them get it
- Together they answer: "This is for me AND this person can help me"

**Example:**

**Title:** "How to Replace Your Salary with Freelance Writing in 90 Days (Without Platforms Like Upwork)"

**Authority:** "I went from zero to $8K/month in freelance writing in under 6 months—while working full-time. Since then, I've helped 300+ people do the same, with 80% replacing their salary within their first year."

**Test:** Does this make the audience say "That's what I want and they can help me get it"?

## What This Layer Feeds Into

Positioning informs:

**Immediate dependencies:**
- 4-Act Structure (Act 1 uses Title promise and Authority statement)
- Hook Formulas (Opening hooks reinforce Title)

**Downstream dependencies:**
- Chunk Architecture (Content delivers on Title promise)
- Story Arsenal (Stories support Authority type)
- Close Architecture (Close delivers what Title promised)

## Quality Criteria

Your Positioning is solid when:

**Title Quality:**
- [ ] Uses Desire Tap language from Foundation
- [ ] Incorporates actual audience language (X-Ray Q8)
- [ ] Addresses a fear or belief (X-Ray Q5 or Q7)
- [ ] Promises specific transformation (not vague)
- [ ] Would make them say "That's exactly what I want"
- [ ] Is clear and concrete (not clever or vague)

**Authority Quality:**
- [ ] Matches authority type they'll respect (from X-Ray Q5)
- [ ] Is specific (numbers, timeframes, results)
- [ ] Feels like service, not bragging
- [ ] Answers "Why should I listen to you?"
- [ ] Builds trust without creating distance
- [ ] Is believable and verifiable

**Integration Quality:**
- [ ] Title and Authority work together
- [ ] Positioning aligns with Foundation
- [ ] No contradictions or disconnects
- [ ] Feels cohesive and natural

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Clever Over Clear**
Bad: "The Secret Sauce to Success"
Good: "How to Build a 6-Figure Coaching Business in 12 Months"
→ Clear beats clever every time

**Mistake 2: Tapping Wrong Desire**
Title focuses on surface desire when you've identified deep desire
→ Use X-Ray Question 2 (what they REALLY want)

**Mistake 3: Over-Credentialing**
"I have 3 PhDs, 15 certifications, and have spoken at 100 conferences..."
→ Sounds impressive, feels distant. Authority should invite, not intimidate.

**Mistake 4: Under-Credentialing**
"I'm just a regular person who figured this out"
→ Doesn't answer "Why you?" Be humble but clear about why you can help.

**Mistake 5: Generic Authority**
"I'm an expert in marketing"
→ Specific numbers, timeframes, results. "I've helped 200+ businesses increase conversions by an average of 40%"

**Mistake 6: Title Doesn't Match X-Ray**
Using your language instead of their language
→ Review X-Ray Question 8 and use their exact phrases
