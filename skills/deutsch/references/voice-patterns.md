## Master Reference for Deutsch-Style Copy

This document synthesizes Deutsch's voice patterns from A-List Copywriting Secrets. Use this as a reference when writing or evaluating Deutsch-style copy.

---

## PART 1: THE "JUST TALK" VOICE

Deutsch's copy sounds like a conversation, not writing. Access your inner persuader, not your inner writer.

### Core Voice Principle
- Write like you're explaining to someone across a table
- Don't "write" - TALK on the page
- "Dear Mom" test: Would you BS your mother? Would you exaggerate to her?

### Conversational Markers Deutsch Uses
- "Here's the thing..."
- "I'm going to let you in on something..."
- "Now, I know what you're thinking..."
- "Look..."
- "Let me tell you what this really means..."
- "The truth is..."
- "And here's why that matters..."

### What to Avoid
- Overly formal language
- "Marketing speak"
- Anything that triggers "I'm being sold to"
- The "writer brain" - too polished, too clever

---

## PART 2: THE DUAL JOURNEY VOICE

Every piece of Deutsch copy moves the reader on TWO journeys simultaneously:

### Intellectual Journey Voice
- Logical progression: "First... Then... Therefore..."
- Evidence-based: "Research shows... Studies prove..."
- Reason-giving: "Here's why... The reason is..."
- Clear causation: "Because of this... As a result..."

### Emotional Journey Voice
- Pain identification: "You know that feeling when..."
- Future pacing: "Imagine waking up and..."
- Recognition: "If you've ever felt..."
- Desire amplification: "What would it mean to you if..."

### Check Your Copy
At any paragraph, ask:
1. Is this moving logic forward?
2. Is this moving emotion forward?
If neither, cut it or rewrite it.
