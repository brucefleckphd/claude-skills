# David Deutsch Voice Patterns - Stories

## Story-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing or evaluating Deutsch-style stories.

## THE DEUTSCH STORY VOICE

### Core Principle
Stories must have an ARC, not a straight line. Beginning → Conflict → Resolution. People doing stuff. Drama and tension.

### The TV Show Test
"You know how when you watch TV shows? And all of a sudden you find yourself, I can't turn it off. I have to see what happens. You want to make your stories like that."

## VOICE PATTERNS BY STORY TYPE

### 1. Origin Story Pattern
How the product/solution came to be:
- Problem existed
- Founder struggled
- Found solution
- Refined it
- Now shares with you

**Voice:** Humble journey, not bragging
"This is how I did it" beats "Look how great this is"

### 2. Nightmare Story Pattern
Consequences without the solution:
- "I'll never forget 1986, how I lost all my money"
- Steel falling on someone's head
- The day everything went wrong
- Paint the disaster

**Voice:** Visceral, real, you-are-there
Fear activation, not distant description

### 3. Transformation Story Pattern
Life change through the solution:
- Before state (suffering)
- Discovery moment
- After state (thriving)

**Voice:** Contrast is everything
The bigger the gap between before/after, the stronger the story

## STORY STRUCTURE VOICE

### The Arc Pattern
NOT: "This happened, then this, then this" (straight line)
BUT: "Ordinary world → Crisis → Struggle → Transformation" (arc)

### The Hero's Journey Voice
1. **Ordinary World** - "Like many of you, he was just..."
2. **Call to Adventure** - "Then one day, everything changed..."
3. **Obstacles and Enemies** - "But it wasn't easy. He faced..."
4. **Allies Appear** - "That's when he met someone who..."
5. **Turning Point** - "And that's when it hit him..."
6. **Return with Knowledge** - "Now he's here to share..."

### Conflict Injection
Every story needs drama:
- Where's the struggle?
- What went wrong?
- Who opposed them?
- What obstacle almost stopped them?

## STORY VOICE MARKERS

### Beginning Patterns
- "I'll never forget the day..."
- "She didn't know it yet, but..."
- "It started like any other..."
- "Nobody expected what happened next..."

### Tension Patterns
- "But then..."
- "That's when everything changed..."
- "Little did he know..."
- "The worst was yet to come..."

### Resolution Patterns
- "And that's how..."
- "From that day on..."
- "Looking back now..."
- "Which is why..."

## THE ALLY APPEARANCE

The hero meets someone who opens their eyes:
- "I met this man accidentally"
- "He opened my eyes to a new way"
- "Everything I knew was wrong"
- Mentor, teacher, chance meeting

**Voice:** Discovery, revelation, turning point
