# Cage Architecture Layer

## What This Layer Covers

The Architecture Layer is where you build the actual presentation. After understanding your audience (Foundation) and framing the conversation (Positioning), you now construct the delivery system that moves them from attention to transformation.

**Six frameworks:**
1. **4-Act Structure** (Tier 1 - Ace) - The complete presentation spine
2. **Stick Strategies** (Tier 3 - Jack) - Attention retention tactics
3. **Chunk Architecture** (Tier 2 - Queen) - Content unit design system
4. **Story Arsenal** (Tier 2 - Queen) - Narrative frameworks
5. **Hook Formulas** (Tier 3 - Jack) - Opening attention grabbers
6. **Tease-Don't-Tell Method** (Tier 3 - Jack) - Forward momentum creation

**Core principle:** Architecture serves the Desire Tap. Every element should move the audience toward what they already want.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the Architecture layer when:

- You've completed Foundation (Desire Tap + X-Ray)
- You've completed Positioning (Title + Authority)
- You're ready to build the presentation structure
- You need to improve engagement/retention
- Content feels disorganized or doesn't flow
- Diagnosing why people drop off mid-presentation

**Prerequisites:** Foundation and Positioning must be complete. You cannot build effective architecture without knowing the Desire Tap and Title promise.

## The Six Frameworks

### 1. 4-Act Structure (The Spine)

**What it is:** The complete presentation blueprint. Everything else attaches to this.

**The 4 Acts:**
- **Act 1: Introduction (<2 minutes)** - Hook, promise, authority, expectations
- **Act 2: Stick Strategies** - Keep them from leaving, build momentum
- **Act 3: Core Content (5-10 chunks)** - Deliver transformation, build value
- **Act 4: Close (5-10 minutes)** - Transition to offer, call to action

**Why this matters:** This is the blueprint. Every other framework fits into one of these four acts.

### 2. Stick Strategies (Retention Tactics)

**What it is:** Specific tactics to keep people from leaving at critical transition points.

**Core sticks:**
- Open Loop (create unresolved tension)
- Promise Ladder (upcoming value previews)
- Pattern Interrupt (novelty/surprise)
- Tease (hint at something amazing coming)
- Question (create active thinking)

**Why this matters:** People leave during transitions. Sticks prevent that.

### 3. Chunk Architecture (Content Units)

**What it is:** Design system for content units that teach one thing memorably.

**Each chunk contains:**
- One core teaching point
- Supporting story or example
- Practical application
- Transition/tease to next chunk

**Optimal:** 5-10 chunks in Act 3

**Why this matters:** Chunks are how you deliver transformation. Too many = overwhelm. Too few = insufficient value.

### 4. Story Arsenal (Narrative Frameworks)

**What it is:** Framework for selecting and structuring stories that support teaching points.

**Story types:**
- Personal experience
- Client/student success
- Case study
- Illustrative metaphor
- Contrarian example

**Story structure:** Setup → Conflict → Resolution → Application

**Why this matters:** Stories make teaching sticky and believable.

### 5. Hook Formulas (Opening Grabbers)

**What it is:** Opening attention-grabbers that tap desire immediately.

**Core hooks:**
- Shocking Stat
- Contrarian Statement
- Vulnerability Opener
- Question Hook
- Story Hook
- Promise Hook

**Why this matters:** You have seconds to capture attention. Hooks do that.

### 6. Tease-Don't-Tell Method (Momentum Creation)

**What it is:** Strategic withholding to create forward momentum and curiosity.

**How it works:**
- Hint at valuable content coming later
- Create open loops throughout
- Reveal strategically, not prematurely
- Build anticipation for the close

**Why this matters:** If you tell everything, there's no reason to buy. Teasing creates desire for more.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Map the 4-Act Structure Skeleton

**Start with the spine:**

1. **Act 1: Introduction (<2 minutes)**
   - What's the hook?
   - How will you deliver on the title promise preview?
   - How will you establish authority?
   - What expectations will you set?

2. **Act 2: Stick Strategies (2-5 minutes)**
   - What will keep them from leaving after intro?
   - How will you build momentum?
   - What transitions need sticks?

3. **Act 3: Core Content (30-45 minutes)**
   - What 5-10 things do they need to learn?
   - How will chunks sequence logically?
   - Where will stories support teaching?

4. **Act 4: Close (5-10 minutes)**
   - How will you transition to the offer?
   - What's the call to action?
   - (Note: Full close design happens in Conversion layer)

**Output:** Skeleton with timing and key elements identified

### Step 2: Design Your Chunks

**For each chunk:**

1. **Identify the teaching point**
   - What's the ONE thing this chunk teaches?
   - How does it move them toward the Desire Tap?
   - Does it deliver on the Title promise?

2. **Sequence the chunks**
   - What's the logical order?
   - Does each build on the previous?
   - Do they tell a coherent story together?

**Example sequence:**
- Chunk 1: "Why most [attempts] fail" (diagnosis)
- Chunk 2: "The missing piece" (key insight)
- Chunk 3: "The new approach" (framework introduction)
- Chunks 4-7: "The 4 components" (framework details)
- Chunk 8: "Common mistakes" (error prevention)
- Chunk 9: "Putting it together" (integration)

**Output:** 5-10 chunks with teaching points and sequence

### Step 3: Select Stories for Each Chunk

**For each chunk, select a supporting story:**

1. **Choose story type:**
   - Personal experience (builds connection)
   - Client success (provides proof)
   - Case study (demonstrates application)
   - Metaphor (clarifies concept)
   - Contrarian example (challenges assumptions)

2. **Structure the story:**
   - **Setup:** Context and situation (30 seconds)
   - **Conflict:** Problem or challenge (60 seconds)
   - **Resolution:** How it was solved (60 seconds)
   - **Application:** What this means for them (30 seconds)

**Total time per story:** 2-3 minutes

**Output:** One story per chunk, structured and timed

### Step 4: Design Your Hook (Act 1)

**Create 3-5 hook options using formulas:**

**Hook Formula 1: Shocking Stat**
"Did you know that 90% of people who try [thing] fail—not because they lack talent, but because they're using the wrong approach?"

**Hook Formula 2: Contrarian Statement**
"Everything you've been told about [topic] is backwards. And I can prove it in the next 45 minutes."

**Hook Formula 3: Vulnerability Opener**
"Three years ago, I was [in their shoes]. I'd tried everything and failed. But then I discovered something that changed everything..."

**Hook Formula 4: Question Hook**
"What if I told you that [desired outcome] doesn't require [what they think it requires]? Would you want to know the real path?"

**Hook Formula 5: Story Hook**
"Let me tell you about the day I [dramatic moment]. It taught me the one thing that separates success from failure in [topic]..."

**Hook Formula 6: Promise Hook**
"In the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to [desired outcome]—and I'll give you the complete roadmap before we're done."

**Select the strongest** hook that:
- Taps the Desire from Foundation
- Aligns with the Title from Positioning
- Grabs attention immediately
- Sets up Act 3 content

**Output:** One hook, scripted and ready

### Step 5: Place Stick Strategies (Act 2 and transitions)

**Identify critical transition points:**
- After Act 1 (intro to content)
- Between major chunks (every 10-15 minutes)
- Before Act 4 (content to close)

**For each transition, select a stick:**

**Stick 1: Open Loop**
"Before I show you the complete system, I need to warn you about the #1 mistake that kills results. I'll reveal that in 10 minutes, but first..."

**Stick 2: Promise Ladder**
"We've covered X, and in a moment I'll show you Y. But the real breakthrough comes in section 3 when I reveal Z."

**Stick 3: Pattern Interrupt**
"Stop. Before we go further, I need you to do something. Grab a pen..."

**Stick 4: Tease**
"The technique I'm about to share in Chunk 5 is responsible for 80% of my results. But it only works if you understand Chunk 4 first..."

**Stick 5: Question**
"So here's what I want you to ask yourself: If [scenario], would you [action]? Hold that thought..."

**Output:** Sticks placed at 3-5 critical transitions

### Step 6: Weave Tease-Don't-Tell Throughout

**Identify what NOT to fully reveal:**
- Advanced implementations
- Complete system details
- Specific tools/resources
- Insider secrets
- Personal support/customization

**Create 5-7 tease moments:**

**Tease Moment 1 (Early):**
"The framework I'm teaching you today is just the foundation. There are 3 advanced variations I use for different scenarios—I'll mention those later..."

**Tease Moment 2 (Mid):**
"Now, implementing this requires a specific tool stack. I'll share the exact tools I use at the end..."

**Tease Moment 3 (Late):**
"This is the 80% that gets you 80% of results. The remaining 20% that gets you to 100%? That's where it gets really interesting, and I'll show you how to get that in a moment..."

**Key principle:** Give the "what" and "why," tease the complete "how."

**Output:** 5-7 tease moments placed strategically

### Step 7: Test the Complete Architecture

**Run through the full structure:**

1. **Act 1:** Does the hook grab attention and deliver on title?
2. **Act 2:** Will the sticks keep them from leaving?
3. **Act 3:** Do chunks flow logically? Are stories compelling?
4. **Transitions:** Are all critical transitions covered with sticks?
5. **Teases:** Do they create desire for more without frustrating?

**Timing check:**
- Act 1: <2 minutes
- Act 2: 2-5 minutes
- Act 3: 30-45 minutes (5-7 min per chunk for 5-10 chunks)
- Act 4: 5-10 minutes (designed in Conversion layer)
- **Total:** 40-60 minutes

**Quality check:**
- Does everything trace back to the Desire Tap?
- Does the architecture deliver on the Title promise?
- Would they say "I got value" even without buying?
- Does the content create desire for the complete system?

**Output:** Complete presentation architecture, ready for Conversion layer

## What This Layer Feeds Into

Architecture feeds directly into:

**Immediate dependencies:**
- Close Architecture (Act 4 builds on Act 3 value)
- Objection Anticipation (Chunks and Stories can preemptively handle objections)

**The architecture IS the presentation.** Conversion layer just adds the close.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Many Chunks**
10+ chunks = overwhelm and analysis paralysis
→ Aim for 5-10. Save additional teaching for the program.

**Mistake 2: No Stories**
Pure teaching without narrative = dry and forgettable
→ Minimum one story per chunk. Stories make teaching stick.

**Mistake 3: Weak Transitions**
Jumping from chunk to chunk without sticks
→ People drop off during transitions. Use sticks.

**Mistake 4: Giving Away Everything**
Teaching the complete system in the presentation
→ Use Tease-Don't-Tell. Give the foundation, save the depth.

**Mistake 5: No Hook**
Starting with "Thanks for joining, today we're going to talk about..."
→ Boring. Use a hook formula. Grab attention immediately.

**Mistake 6: Acts 1 or 4 Too Long**
10-minute intro or 20-minute close
→ Act 1 <2 min, Act 4 5-10 min. Respect their time.

**Mistake 7: Chunks Don't Connect**
Random tips instead of logical progression
→ Chunks should tell a story together.

**Mistake 8: Stories Without Application**
Telling stories that entertain but don't teach
→ Every story needs "What this means for you"

## Examples: Complete Architecture Work

### Example: Freelance Writing Course

**Foundation (from previous layers):**
- Desire Tap: Freedom and autonomy
- Title: "How to Replace Your Salary with Freelance Writing in 90 Days"

**4-Act Structure:**

**Act 1: Introduction (90 seconds)**
- **Hook (Question Hook):** "What if I told you that replacing your salary with freelance writing doesn't require a huge portfolio, thousands of followers, or years of experience? In fact, the fastest path requires none of those things. Interested?"
- **Authority:** "I went from zero to $8K/month in 6 months while working full-time..."
- **Promise:** "In the next 45 minutes, I'll show you the exact 3-step system I used and that 300+ students have used to do the same."

**Act 2: Stick Strategies (3 minutes)**
- **Stick (Promise Ladder):** "We'll cover the 3-step system, but the real breakthrough comes in Step 3 when I show you the exact email template that lands 80% of my clients. But Step 3 only works if you understand Steps 1 and 2 first, so let's dive in..."

**Act 3: Core Content (40 minutes - 8 chunks @ 5 min each)**

**Chunk 1: "Why the Traditional Path Fails" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Upwork/Fiverr/content mills = race to bottom
- Story: Student who spent 6 months on Upwork making $10/article, burned out
- Application: "If you're on platforms competing on price, you're in the wrong game"
- Tease: "The right game is what I call 'Client Magnetism' and I'll show you that in Chunk 3"

**Chunk 2: "The Client Pyramid" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Not all clients are created equal; focus on top 10%
- Story: How I fired $2K/month in low-value clients to make room for one $4K client
- Application: "You need exactly 3-5 high-value clients to replace your salary"
- Tease: "Where do you find them? That's Chunk 4"

**Chunk 3: "Client Magnetism vs Client Hunting" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Positioning yourself so clients come to you
- Story: Student who got 10 inbound inquiries in 30 days after repositioning
- Application: "You become magnetic by solving a specific problem for a specific person"
- Tease: "I'll show you how to identify YOUR specific problem and person in Chunk 5"

**Chunk 4: "The 3 Places High-Value Clients Hang Out" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: LinkedIn, niche communities, referrals
- Story: How I landed my first $3K client through a LinkedIn comment
- Application: "You don't need to be everywhere, just in the right 1-2 places"
- Tease: "But showing up isn't enough. You need the positioning, which we covered, AND the outreach system in Chunk 6"

**Chunk 5: "The Positioning Formula" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: "I help [specific person] [solve specific problem] through [your method]"
- Story: Student who went from "I'm a writer" to "I help SaaS companies generate leads through case studies" and 5x'd their rates
- Application: Fill in the formula for yourself
- Tease: "Now that you have positioning, you need the outreach system..."

**Chunk 6: "The 3-Email Outreach System" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Email 1 (value), Email 2 (case study), Email 3 (offer)
- Story: The email sequence that landed me a $5K retainer client
- Application: "This is the system. Now let me show you the one mistake that kills it..."

**Chunk 7: "The Fatal Offer Mistake" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Don't offer "writing services," offer business outcomes
- Story: Student whose response rate jumped from 5% to 40% by changing their offer
- Application: "Frame your offer as the business result they want, not the deliverable"
- Tease: "The offer is critical, but so is pricing. Most people underprice by 50-70%..."

**Chunk 8: "The Pricing Framework" (5 min)**
- Teaching point: Price based on value delivered, not hours worked
- Story: How I went from $50/article to $2K/case study by reframing value
- Application: "Calculate the value you create, then price at 10-20% of that value"
- Tease: "This is the system. But there's one more thing that 80% of people get wrong, and it's the difference between $2K/month and $8K/month..."

**Act 4: Close (7 minutes)** - Designed in Conversion layer

**Total time:** ~50 minutes

**Stories:** 8 (one per chunk)
**Sticks:** 3 (Act 2 + 2 mid-content)
**Teases:** 7 (woven throughout chunks)

### Example: Investment Course

**Foundation:**
- Desire Tap: Financial security and peace of mind
- Title: "How to Build a Worry-Free Retirement Income (Even in Market Crashes)"

**4-Act Structure:**

**Act 1: Introduction (90 seconds)**
- **Hook (Shocking Stat):** "In 2008, the average retirement account lost 30% of its value. In 2020, another 25-35% drop. If you're retired or close to it, you can't afford to lose 30% and wait 10 years to recover. So what do you do?"
- **Authority:** "I've spent 15 years analyzing crash-proof portfolios..."
- **Promise:** "I'll show you 5 income streams that survived every crash since 1929."

- Tease: "Income Floor is the foundation. Income Upside is Chunks 3-7..."

**Chunks 3-7: "The 5 Crash-Proof Income Streams"**
- Teaching point: One stream per chunk
- Story: Real examples from clients
- Tease: Implementation details in the program

**Act 4: Close (8 minutes)** - Designed in Conversion layer

## Advanced Architecture Techniques

### Technique 1: The Story Arc Across Chunks
Instead of disconnected stories, tell one evolving story across multiple chunks.

**Example:**
- Chunk 1: Meet Client X at the beginning (struggling)
- Chunk 3: Client X implements first step (small win)
- Chunk 5: Client X implements complete system (breakthrough)
- Chunk 7: Client X today (transformation complete)

### Technique 2: The Objection-Chunk Integration
Design chunks specifically to handle objections preemptively (used in Objection Burial Method combination framework).

**Example:**
- Objection: "I don't have time"
- Chunk: "The 3-Hour-Per-Week Implementation"

### Technique 3: The Proof Stack
Layer different proof types across chunks:
- Chunk 1: Logic/data proof
- Chunk 3: Story proof
- Chunk 5: Social proof
- Chunk 7: Authority proof
