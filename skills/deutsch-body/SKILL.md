# Deutsch Body

David Deutsch body copy frameworks. Use when writing or evaluating body copy. Covers dual journey structure, energy audit, people doing stuff rule, and making every sentence sell.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing or improving body copy
- Evaluating body copy energy and effectiveness
- Making copy more engaging and readable

## Critical Lessons: Energy Consistency

### Lesson 1: The Mechanism Explanation Trap

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** After a strong story lead, energy dies when you explain your mechanism.

```
DEAD (pure explanation):
"I call them 'skills' and 'agents.'

A skill is like installing a new brain into the AI. Feed it a course the right way, and it doesn't just remember the content. It can EXECUTE the methodology.

An agent is a worker. It uses those skills to complete complex tasks."
```

This is YOUR need to explain, not THEIR need to read. No people doing stuff. No conflict. Energy flatlines.

**THE FIX:** Demonstrate mechanism through story, not definition.

```
ALIVE (story demonstration):
"I tested it immediately. Fed it a webinar brief. 'Write me a pitch using Jason Fladlien's methodology.'

I'd been studying Fladlien for TWO YEARS. Bought his $2,000 course. Took forty pages of notes. Never executed a single strategy.

The AI spit out a 47-minute script in eight minutes.

I read the first page. Then the second. Then I stood up from my chair because I couldn't sit still anymore.

Every hook was EXACTLY where Fladlien would place it..."
```

**THE RULE:** Never define when you can demonstrate. Show the mechanism WORKING through a mini-story.

### Lesson 2: The Deliverables Section Death

**PROBLEM PATTERN:** Listing what they get kills momentum.

```
DEAD (feature list):
"First, you'll read a short guide. 30 minutes, max.

Then you install the code package. Takes five minutes.

Then you use the conversion templates. Step by step.

Finally, you build your first agents."
```

This is obligation, not selling. Both journeys stall.

**THE FIX:** Future-pace the EXPERIENCE, not the features.

```
ALIVE (experience):
"You're going to open the guide. Thirty minutes, maybe less. But halfway through the second page, you're going to sit up straighter in your chair.

Because you're going to realize: 'This isn't another thing I have to learn. This is how to USE everything I already learned.'

You'll grab that copywriting course you bought in 2019. The one you never finished. You'll feed it to the AI using my templates.

Fifteen minutes later, you'll tell the AI: 'Write me a sales email using this methodology.'

What comes back will make you read it twice."
```

**THE RULE:** Don't list deliverables. Narrate the transformation experience.

### Lesson 3: The Energy Equalization Rule

Find your BEST paragraph. Then bring ALL other paragraphs up to that level.

**THE TEST:** Read your copy. Mark where energy peaks (can't stop reading) and where it dips (could skim or skip). Every dip is a potential dropout point.

Common energy killers:
- Pure explanation sections
- Feature lists
- Price justification boilerplate
- "Let me tell you what this means..." transitions

**THE FIX:** Cut the dead paragraphs or inject story/conflict into them.
