## Body Copy-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing or evaluating Deutsch-style body copy.

## THE DEUTSCH BODY COPY VOICE

### Core Principle
Body copy must progress BOTH journeys simultaneously. Every paragraph must have energy. People doing stuff.

### The Energy Standard
"When you read your copy, you know how it is sometimes when you go, oh, that was a great paragraph. You've got to go back to all the other paragraphs and bring them up to that level."

## VOICE PATTERNS FOR ENERGY

### 1. People Doing Stuff Pattern
Copy comes alive with action:
- "Zulu warriors are coming"
- "Auditors being embarrassed"
- "Grandmother fighting"
- Struggle, conflict, movement

**Dead:** "The investment strategy has proven effective over time."
**Alive:** "While Wall Street fat cats were scrambling to explain their losses, Jim quietly collected his checks."

### 2. The Conflict Pattern
Where's the drama?
- Someone fighting something
- Struggle against odds
- Enemies and obstacles
- Stakes and consequences

**Voice Markers:**
- Action verbs
- Antagonists named
- Stakes clear
- Tension present

### 3. The Story Energy Pattern
Binge-worthy TV test:
- Can they turn it off?
- What happens next?
- Cliffhangers between sections
- Drama in every passage

## VOICE PATTERNS TO AVOID

### The Explainer Trap
YOUR need to explain ≠ THEIR need to read
- "Just because I need to tell you how the diabetes cure works... doesn't mean the reader needs to read it"
- If you must explain, make it exciting
- Or cut it

### The Filler Trap
No bridges that don't carry weight:
- Every sentence must SELL
- No "getting from A to B" passages
- If it doesn't sell, cut it

### The Complexity Trap
Caveman simple wins:
- Distracted readers, not students with highlighters
- 12-year-old test
- Short sentences for emphasis
- Simple vocabulary

## THE DUAL JOURNEY IN BODY COPY

### Intellectual Journey Markers
- "Here's why this matters..."
- "The reason is..."
- "Research shows..."
- "Because of this... therefore..."
- Building logic step by step

### Emotional Journey Markers
- "Imagine what it would feel like..."
- "You know that feeling when..."
- "Picture yourself..."
- "That moment when..."
- Escalating emotional stakes

## THE READ ALOUD TEST

Read your copy out loud:
- Where you get bored, they get bored
- Where you stumble, they stumble
- Where energy drops, they leave

Mark those spots. Fix them. Then read aloud again.

---

## THE 80-20 REVISION RULE

Know when good enough is good enough:
- 80% of impact from first 20% of effort
- Don't chase the last 5%
- Ship at 95%
- Better to write new promotion than perfect this one
