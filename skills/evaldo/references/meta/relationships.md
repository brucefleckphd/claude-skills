# Evaldo Framework Relationships

How frameworks connect and flow into each other.

## Foundation → Application

### Philosophy Flows Into Everything
```
philosophy-one-belief → ALL other frameworks
  (Every element supports the One Belief)

philosophy-croc-brain → headlines, leads, bullets
  (All front-end elements must pass filters)

philosophy-three-box → ideas-new-mechanism
  (Ideas must pass before development)
```

### Ideas Flow Into Structure
```
ideas-new-mechanism → leads-10-questions
ideas-stockholm-shoe → headlines-violation
ideas-competitor-analysis → ideas-new-mechanism
```

### Structure Flows Into Writing
```
leads-10-questions → leads-first-5-minutes
leads-10-questions → body-proof-types
leads-10-questions → close-stacking
```

## Element Relationships

### Headlines ↔ Leads
```
headlines-open-loops → leads-punch-in-gut
headlines-curiosity-benefit → leads-story-types
headlines-13-boosters → leads-credibility
```

### Leads ↔ Body
```
leads-transition-to-body → body-teaching-sections
leads-inception → body-proof-pyramid
leads-gradualization → body-proof-types
```

### Body ↔ Close
```
body-objection-inoculation → close-objection-handling
body-future-pacing → close-urgency
body-proof-pyramid → close-guarantee
```

### Close ↔ Lifts
```
close-urgency → lifts-campaign-structure
close-stacking → lifts-angle-variety
```
