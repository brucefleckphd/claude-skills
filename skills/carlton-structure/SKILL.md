# Carlton Structure - Steps 11-12 of the Simple Writing System

"All you really need to sell something right away..."

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning the structure of a sales letter
- Designing sales funnels
- Choosing delivery systems
- Architecting the flow of persuasion
- Applying the basic sales message formula

## The Structure Philosophy

### Simplicity First

> "All you really need to sell something right away..."

Carlton's approach: Get the basics right. Complexity comes later.

### The Starting Point Problem

> "Usually beginners spend too much time 'clearing their throat' at the beginning of a piece of copy."
>
> "I often cut out the first paragraph or even first page of my ads just before my final draft, realizing what I had written really wasn't all that important."
>
> "There's an old saying that direct mail firms take the first two pages of an ad a copywriter gives them and crumple them up."

**Rule:** Start where the action is.

## Step 11: Your Sales Funnel

### Types of Campaigns

Know what type you're writing for:

**Evergreen:** Doesn't change, runs continuously
**Launch:** Time-bound, builds momentum
**Joint Venture:** Partnership promotion
**Affiliate:** Promoting others' products
**Lead Generation:** Capturing prospects
**Multi-step:** Sequence of touches
**Single Sale:** One-shot conversion

### Delivery Systems

Match your copy to the medium:

**Email:**
- Subject line = headline
- Shorter attention spans
- Can't include everything
- Links to more info

**Video:**
- Script structures differently
- Visual elements
- Pacing matters
- Loading time consideration

**Websites/Landing Pages:**
- Scrolling behavior
- Above the fold matters
- Multiple call to action points
- Design supports copy

**Direct Mail:**
- Physical elements (envelope, paper)
- Longer reading environment
- Can include inserts
- Personalization options

**Print Ads:**
- Size constraints
- Competing for attention
- Quick decisions
- Limited space

**PR/Articles:**
- Soft sell approach
- Value first
- Call to action subtle
- Credibility building

**Social Media:**
- Platform norms
- Engagement first
- Personality driven
- Short attention

### Know Your Delivery Shortcomings

> "Know the limits and demands of the technology."

Consider:
- Loading time for video
- Spam filtering for emails
- Character limits for ads
- Obscure SEO blunders

Also know:
- Expectations of your prospect for time, length, attitude
- Cost and rules of each platform

### What Are You Trying To Accomplish?

> "Always write copy with a goal in mind. What do you want your prospect to DO?"
>
> "This tip alone should change your life."

**Possible goals:**
- Buy now
- Sign up for list
- Call a number
- Request information
- Share with others
- Start a trial

## Step 12: The Basic Sales Message

### The Master Formula

Everything you need for a sales message:

1. **Here's who I am...**
2. **Here's what I've got for you...**
3. **Here's why it's important for your life right now...**
4. **Here's what to do now.**

That's it. Everything else is elaboration.

### The "So What?" Test

> "This test helps beginners write copy much faster than trying to get it perfect the first time."

**Process:**
1. Get it all down on paper
2. Leave it for 24 hours
3. Come back and read it
4. After every paragraph, ask: "So what?"
5. If you can't answer why they should care, cut or rewrite

### Classic Salesmanship Secrets

**The One-Two Punch:**
People have two sets of reasons for buying:

1. **RATIONAL reasons** - to explain to spouse, neighbors, brother-in-law
2. **EMOTIONAL A-Brain reasons** - that seal the deal deep inside

Address BOTH in your structure.

### David Garfinkel's Reasons People Buy

Use these as structural checkpoints:
- To make money
- To save money
- To save time
- To save effort
- To reduce pain
- To increase health
- To increase pleasure

**Application tip:**
> "The key thing to do is not to literally write a headline that says: 'Increase Your Pleasure!', but to apply it to a specific situation."

## Offer Structure

### The Offer Elements

**Price:**
- "More-than-fair" price (in the visitor's mind)
- Contrast with higher value

**Value:**
- Outrageous value
- Perceived value is everything
- Stack the components

**Bonuses:**
- Mooch-pleasing bonuses
- Make them worth buying on their own
- Each should be desirable independently

**Guarantee:**
- Paranoia-calming guarantee
- Risk reversal
- (See Step 14 for more detail)

## Structural Flow

### The 17-Point System Flow

The Simple Writing System creates this natural flow:

**Foundation (Steps 1-4):**
Research → Avatar → USP → Features/Benefits

**Core Elements (Steps 5-7):**
Bullets → Testimonials → Hooks

**Salesmanship (Steps 8-10):**
Mentality → Voice/Story → Headlines

**Structure (Steps 11-12):**
Funnel/Delivery → Basic Message

**Persuasion & Close (Steps 13-17):**
Big Promise → Risk Reversal → Turbulence → Bonuses → Close

### Structural Principles

**Greased Slide:**
Every element leads to the next. No reason to stop reading.

**Proof Density:**
Layer proof throughout, not just in one section.

**Emotional Progression:**
Build emotional intensity toward the close.

**Action Orientation:**
Every section moves toward the final action.

## Be Controversial

### The Line Rule

> "Find the line, then take 3 steps over it."

### The Client Discomfort Test

> "If you're writing for a client, they should feel uneasy about running the ad. The worst thing is for them to say: 'I love the copy. I can't wait to run it.'"
