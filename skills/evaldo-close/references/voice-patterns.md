## Close-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing close sections.

## THE EVALDO CLOSE VOICE

### Core Principle
The close doesn't sell - it makes the sale official. By the time you reach the close, they should already want it. The close removes final barriers and makes it easy to act.

### The Close Mindset
- You've earned the right to close
- Close with confidence, not desperation
- Remove barriers, don't push
- Make action feel inevitable
