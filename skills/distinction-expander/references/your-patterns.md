# Your Teaching Patterns — Template

> **Instructions:** Fill in each section with YOUR teaching patterns. The Distinction Expander uses this file to match teaching units to your voice. See `richs-patterns-EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example.

## Pattern 1: [Name Your Primary Pattern]
[How do you typically introduce new ideas? Do you tell stories first? Ask questions? Show demonstrations? Describe your default approach here.]

## Pattern 2: [Name Your Second Pattern]
[What's your go-to structure when the first approach isn't right? Describe it.]

## Pattern 3: [Name Your Third Pattern]
[Add more patterns as needed. Most teachers have 3-6 recurring delivery patterns.]

## Your Voice Markers
- [How would students describe your teaching style?]
- [What words/phrases do you naturally repeat?]
- [Are you direct? Gentle? Confrontational? Story-driven? Data-driven?]
- [Do you use humor? Analogies? Personal stories?]
- [What makes YOUR teaching voice recognizable?]

## Voice Anti-Patterns (What Doesn't Sound Like You)
- [What language would sound wrong coming from you?]
- [What teaching styles are NOT yours?]
- [What phrases would your students find jarring or inauthentic?]

---

**The rule:** If the teaching unit doesn't sound like YOU said it, rewrite it.
