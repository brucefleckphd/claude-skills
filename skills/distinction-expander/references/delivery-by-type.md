# Delivery Strategy by Distinction Type (v2.0)

## Collapsed Distinctions
**Primary:** Show the COST of keeping them collapsed
**Secondary:** Student identifies specific situation where the collapse hurt them
**Flash:** Self-Recognition — walk the student through their own experience. They discover they've been treating two different things as one. Three-Act: Act 1 (they describe their problem), Act 2 (they apply their default solution), Act 3 (reveal: the "solution" made it worse because it addressed the wrong half of the collapse).
**Example gap:** "How many of you use the word 'strategy' every day? Now — define it. And then define 'tactics.' Are they different things? Because I guarantee you're treating them as the same thing, and it's costing you."

## Perceptual Distinctions
**Primary:** Name the category, then show ONE vivid example with full emotional detail
**Secondary:** Student scans own business and counts instances (produces a written list)
**Flash:** Story where Rich gains the perception and it changes a specific decision. Act 1: Rich faces a problem. Act 2: Rich applies the obvious approach (doesn't work). Act 3: Rich sees the new category and the problem dissolves.
**Example gap:** "Watch me make a series of decisions for the next 3 minutes. See if you can spot what I'm doing differently than you would."

## Inversion Distinctions
**Primary:** State the common belief, pause, flip it
**Secondary:** Show evidence contradicting the common belief
**Flash:** Story with full buildup. The flip needs narrative investment to land with force. Three-Act: Act 1 (Rich believes the common thing), Act 2 (Rich acts on the common belief, gets burned), Act 3 (Rich discovers the truth is backwards).
**Example gap:** "Everyone in this room has been told X. I believed it for 20 years. Then I saw this..."

## Domain-Transfer Distinctions
**Primary:** Tell the source-domain story fully, then reveal the target mapping
**Secondary:** Student maps to their specific industry (produces a written comparison)
**Flash:** Story that starts in the source domain and gradually reveals the parallel. The "Now I see" moment is when the student realizes the two domains operate by the same principle.
**Example gap:** "Let me tell you about how architects work. They never touch the building..."

## Stance Distinctions
**Primary:** Describe both stances, ask "Which one are you in RIGHT NOW?"
**Secondary:** Student catches themselves in the disempowering stance in real time
**Flash:** Self-Recognition — the student sees their own stance. Three-Act: Act 1 (Rich shows someone in stance A), Act 2 (audience identifies with that person), Act 3 (reveal: that stance is the bottleneck, and switching to stance B changes the outcome immediately).
**Example gap:** "There's a question I'm about to ask you. Your first reaction to it will tell you everything about where you're operating from."

## Structural Distinctions
**Primary:** Draw the structure visually, show what's missing from student's setup
**Secondary:** Student diagrams their own system (produces a written artifact)
**Flash:** Live Demo — build the structure so they see it emerge. Show the missing piece. When they see what they've been leaving out, the structure clicks.
**Example gap:** "Draw your business on paper right now. I'll wait. Now let me show you what you left out — and why it matters."

## Flash Design Principles (All Types)

1. **One story, full depth.** Not five summaries.
2. **Three-Act structure by default.** Student commits to wrong answer in Act 2.
3. **Include emotional specificity.** How Rich FELT, not just what happened.
4. **Lead with the most emotionally resonant example**, not the most intellectually impressive.
5. **Add one backup angle** (5-7 lines) for students the primary misses.
6. **Never announce the epiphany.** If you write "See it now?" — delete it.
