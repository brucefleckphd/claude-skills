# Rich's Teaching Patterns — Quick Reference (v2.0)

## Pattern 1: Revelation Over Declaration
Never TELL the distinction directly. Set up a situation where it REVEALS itself.
- Build something live → the architecture-vs-tools distinction shows itself
- Walk through a decision → the strategy-vs-tactics distinction shows itself
**Use this as the default pattern.** Only use direct declaration when time is extremely limited.

## Pattern 2: Three Camps
Create three categories where most teachers create two. Two = coin flip. Three = genuine choice.
- Camp 1 (obviously wrong), Camp 2 (common default), Camp 3 (the answer)
- Student self-selects, then sees why Camp 3 wins
**Use when:** The distinction involves rejecting TWO wrong options, not just one.

## Pattern 3: The Personal Artifact
Rich shows his actual system/file/tool as evidence. Not hypothetical. Not "imagine if." His actual CLAUDE.md file, his actual AI system, his actual workflow.
- The artifact IS the proof
- The pivot question forces students to compare their version to Rich's
- "Let me pull this up" is more powerful than "let me tell you about"
**Use when:** Rich has a tangible artifact that embodies the distinction. (This is often the strongest possible Flash design.)

## Pattern 4: Self-Identification Through Story
Tell a story about a specific person. Structure it so listeners identify with the "before."
When the breakthrough lands in the story, it lands in the listener.
**Use when:** The distinction requires emotional engagement, not just intellectual recognition.

## Pattern 5: The Unifying Metaphor
Find ONE metaphor that carries through all six components (Gap, Contrast, Flash, Name, Application, Reinforcement). When the metaphor is that clean, the distinction becomes self-reinforcing.
- "Eyes vs. hands" carried the entire Architectural Literacy unit
- "Scar tissue" carried the entire Instructions from Failures unit
**Use always.** Every expanded distinction should have one throughline metaphor.

## Pattern 6: Historical Validation of the Collapse
When the student's wrong mental model had a legitimate historical basis, NAME that history. "For 40 years, this WAS the prerequisite." This prevents the student from feeling stupid and accelerates their willingness to release the old model.
**Use when:** The collapse has a rational origin (not just confusion).

## Rich's Voice Markers
- Direct — no hedging
- Story-driven — real names, real numbers, real outcomes
- Confrontational when needed — "you're doing this right now"
- Concrete — specific scenarios, not abstractions
- Energized — momentum, not plodding
- Emotionally specific — names the feeling, doesn't hide behind events
- Self-indicting when appropriate — "I made this exact mistake"
- Compression — "Same failure. Different design." Two sentences. Done.

## Voice Anti-Patterns (From 17 Critic Evaluations)
These patterns REDUCE voice fidelity. Avoid them:
- **Parallel case study format** — 5 examples with identical setup/problem/solution/result structure reads like McKinsey, not Rich
- **Rhetorical speeches in Reinforcement** — "Here's what I want you to hear..." is Tony Robbins, not Rich
- **Borrowed terminology** — "Antifragile," "graceful degradation," "paradigm shift" signal borrowed authority
- **Corporate talking points** — "REDEFINING VALUE," "This isn't about replacing people" reads like press releases
- **Consultant-speak results** — "Result? The project finishes faster. The quality is higher." Rich would say: "And suddenly the whole thing worked."
- **Explaining jokes** — "See it now?" after the flash is like explaining a punchline
- **List-heavy parallelism** — 5+ items in identical structure is templating, not teaching. Rich escalates in stories, not lists.

**The rule:** Voice is strongest in chronological stories. Voice drops in parallel structures, concept explanations, and rhetorical arguments. When in doubt, tell a story.

**If the teaching unit doesn't sound like Rich said it, rewrite it.**
