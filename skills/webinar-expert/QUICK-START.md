## The 3-Minute Decision Framework

### Question 1: What's your price point?

**Under $500** → Use Fladlien bias
- Shorter (60-75 min)
- Direct and fast
- Heavy commitment psychology
- Emotional leverage

**$500-$2,000** → Use Balanced approach
- Medium length (75-90 min)
- Best of both experts
- Synthesized frameworks

**$2,000+** → Use Cage bias
- Longer (90-120+ min)
- Depth and comprehensiveness
- Desire tap philosophy
- Retention focus

### Question 2: What's your market sophistication?

**Level 1-2 (Unaware/Problem-Aware)** → Fladlien
- Simple, direct, emotional
- Clear problem → solution

**Level 3 (Solution-Aware)** → Balanced
- Prove why you, not just why anything

**Level 4-5 (Product/Most Aware)** → Cage
- Nuanced, sophisticated
- Contrarian insights
- Deep desire activation

### Question 3: What's your primary goal?

**Maximize Conversion** → Fladlien
- Commitment psychology
- Tight close
- Direct urgency

**Build Relationship** → Cage
- Depth and value
- Community feeling
- Comprehensive content

**Both** → Balanced
- Cage opening/middle
- Fladlien close

## Universal Truths (Always Apply)

All experts agree on these 10 principles:

1. **Handle objections before the close** - Never wait for Q&A
2. **Build authority early** - First 5-10 minutes
3. **Structure content in chunks** - 3-5 major teaching units
4. **Tease without revealing** - What and why, not how
5. **Use stories strategically** - 3-5 minimum
6. **Create momentum throughout** - Energy should build
7. **Justify price before reveal** - 10x value perception
8. **Make offer crystal clear** - Zero confusion
9. **Urgency must be real** - Ethical deadlines only
10. **Proof must be abundant** - 10+ specific examples

## Expected Performance Benchmarks

### Conversion Rates (Attendees → Buyers)

| Price | Expected | Good | Excellent |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|
| $100-$500 | 2-5% | 5-8% | 8-15% |
| $500-$2K | 1.5-4% | 4-6% | 6-10% |
| $2K-$5K | 1-3% | 3-5% | 5-8% |
| $5K+ | 0.5-2% | 2-3% | 3-5% |

### Other Key Metrics

- **Registration:** 25-40% of invites (warm traffic)
- **Attendance:** 25-35% live, 15-25% automated
- **Stay-Through:** 50-70% watch to pitch
- **Replay Conversion:** 40-60% of live conversion

## The 5-Tier Quality Check

Before launching, your webinar should score A or B+ on:

### Tier 1: Structure
✓ Opening (authority + desire + promise)
✓ Content chunks (3-5 major sections)
✓ Transitions (4-part system)
✓ Close (value build + price + urgency)

### Tier 2: Principles
✓ Fladlien: Commitment (100+ yeses), emotions (3-4 activated)
✓ Cage: Desire tap, objections (all 10 pre-handled), retention
✓ Universal: Stories, proof, teasing, momentum

### Tier 3: Context Fit
✓ Right length for price point
✓ Right depth for sophistication
✓ Right approach for goal
✓ Right style for product type

### Tier 4: Craft
✓ Opening hooks in 30 seconds
✓ Content clear and compelling
✓ Stories memorable
✓ Close persuasive and natural

### Tier 5: Benchmarks
✓ Time allocations match standards
✓ Content elements meet minimums
✓ Performance (if data available) meets expectations

**Launch Standard:** A-grade (90%+) or B+ (87-89%) with clear optimization path

## Fladlien's Unique Genius

Use when you need tactical execution and conversion maximization:

1. **150 Yeses** - Build commitment through micro-agreements
2. **6 Emotional Levers** - Systematic emotion activation (greed, fear, altruism, envy, pride, shame)
3. **Price Cascade** - $100K alternative → market rate → your price
4. **Bonus Time Ratio** - Spend 2-3x more time on bonuses than main offer
5. **4-Part Transitions** - Bridge, seed, callback, momentum
6. **Stack Slide** - Visual accumulation with running total
7. **Objection Reversal** - Turn objections into reasons to buy (Q&A)

## Cage's Unique Genius

Use when you need depth, sophistication, and relationship building:

1. **Desire Tap** - Activate existing desire, don't create new
2. **8-Question X-Ray** - Diagnostic market research framework
3. **Stick Strategy** - 12+ retention tactics to prevent drop-off
4. **Title Alchemy** - Magnetic → Specific → Urgent → Curiosity
5. **10 Universal Objections** - Pre-handle all during content
6. **Content Chunks** - Teach → Apply → Transition
7. **Transformation Architecture** - Before → After → Bridge (your solution)

## Most Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong length for price** - $3K offer in 60 minutes won't convert
2. **Weak opening** - Authority not established, audience skeptical
3. **Too much how** - Giving away implementation kills need to buy
4. **Objections in Q&A** - Should be pre-handled during content
5. **Weak value build** - Price feels expensive because value unclear
6. **No retention tactics** - 70% drop off before pitch
7. **Generic proof** - "Many people succeed" vs. "John made $47K in 90 days"
8. **Fake urgency** - Countdown timers everyone knows are fake
9. **Confused offer** - Unclear what they actually get
10. **No commitment building** - Audience passive, not engaged

3. Identify: What they do well, what they miss
4. Extract specific techniques to test
5. Apply via webinar-expert to your webinar
6. Test and measure results

## Emergency Troubleshooting

**Low registration rate (<20%)**
→ Title problem. Use Cage's Title Alchemy. Test 3-5 variations.

**Low attendance rate (<20%)**
→ Reminder sequence problem. Add more reminders (7 days, 1 day, 1 hour, 10 min, "starting now")

**High drop-off in first 10 minutes**
→ Opening problem. Weak hook or authority. Rebuild opening with proof-first approach.

**Drop-off at 30-40 minute mark**
→ Mid-point slump. Deploy Cage's Stick Strategy. Add pattern interrupt, preview payoff.

**Drop-off right before pitch**
→ Trust gap. Need more proof or objections unhandled. Pre-handle all 10 Universal Objections.

**Low conversion (<1% for <$2K offer)**
→ Multiple issues. Submit to webinar-critic for full 5-tier evaluation.

**High refund rate (>10%)**
→ Expectation mismatch. Promise in webinar doesn't match product delivery. Realign.

## Time Allocation Cheat Sheet

For 90-minute webinar at $2,000 price point:

- **Opening:** 5-9 minutes (authority + desire + promise)
- **Content:** 36-45 minutes (3-4 chunks × 10-12 min each)
- **Close:** 23-32 minutes (value build + bonuses + price + urgency)
- **Q&A:** 9-18 minutes (objection handling + conversion)

Adjust proportionally for other lengths. Higher price = longer content. Lower price = shorter overall.

## Content Element Minimums

Before launch, verify you have:

- ✓ **100-150 micro-yeses** (questions that get head nods)
- ✓ **3-5 stories** (authority, teaching, transformation)
- ✓ **10+ proof points** (varied types, specific numbers)
- ✓ **All 10 Universal Objections** addressed
- ✓ **3-4 emotions** activated (from Fladlien's 6)
- ✓ **3-5 content chunks** (teach-apply-transition)
- ✓ **5+ retention tactics** (prevent drop-off)
- ✓ **4-part transitions** between all major sections

## Expert Selection Shortcut

**Still confused which expert to follow?**

Default to this simple rule:
- Price under $2K + direct goal = **Fladlien**
- Price over $2K + relationship goal = **Cage**
- Everything else = **Balanced synthesis**

Then consult decision trees for specific conflicts.
