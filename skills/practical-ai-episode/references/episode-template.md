# Episode Template — Practical AI for Professionals

This template defines the proven episode structure based on Episode 1's format. Every episode follows this skeleton, adapting the content to the specific business task.

## Episode Structure

### 1. Hook (30-60 seconds)

**Pattern:** "You just found out you need to [task]. The [event/deadline/meeting] is [timeframe]. What do you do?"

**Purpose:** Immediately ground the viewer in a relatable scenario. Name the pain point — the task they've faced before and either dreaded or gotten mediocre results from.

**Host assignment:** Either host can deliver the hook. Keep it conversational — two colleagues setting up the problem.

**Example (Episode 1 — Speeches):**
"You just found out you need to give a speech at your company's annual conference. It's in two weeks. What do you do?"

### 2. Problem Frame (1-2 minutes)

**What to cover:**
- Most people open ChatGPT and type a vague request
- They get generic, forgettable output
- They either use it anyway (mediocre result) or give up on AI for this task
- The problem isn't AI — it's how they're prompting

**Bruce's angle:** Why the brain defaults to lazy prompting (cognitive shortcuts, not knowing what's possible)
**Bower's angle:** What this costs in practice (wasted time, subpar deliverables, missed opportunities)

**Transition to Level 1:** "Let's start with what most people do — and see exactly what happens."

### 3. Level 1: Beginner (5-7 minutes)

**Scenario setup:**
- Low-stakes version of the task
- Quick introduction of who the viewer is pretending to be
- Simple, relatable situation

**Prompt pattern:** Role → Task → Format
- One-shot prompt, no context, minimal instructions
- The kind of prompt 90% of professionals write today

**During the demo:**
- Show the prompt on screen
- Run it live
- React to the output honestly — point out what's decent and what's generic
- Bruce: "Notice how it [specific generic quality]? That's because we gave it nothing to work with."
- Bower: "This is fine for [low-stakes use]. But would you use this for [higher-stakes version]? No way."

**Teaching takeaway:** This approach works for quick, low-stakes tasks. But it hits a ceiling fast.

### 4. Level 2: Intermediate (7-10 minutes)

**Scenario setup:**
- Medium-stakes version — same type of task, higher visibility/consequences
- More details about the situation, audience, and constraints

**Prompt pattern:** RISEN or structured framework
- Role: Who the AI is acting as
- Instructions: What specifically to do
- Situation/Context: Background, constraints, audience
- Execution format: How to structure the output
- Nuance: Tone, things to avoid, emotional awareness

**During the demo:**
- Show the prompt on screen — point out each structural element
- Run it live
- React to the quality jump: "Look at how different this is from Level 1"
- Bruce: "The key insight is [specific structural element] — that one addition changed [specific quality]"
- Bower: "I'd actually use this for [practical scenario]. It saves me [specific time/effort]."

**Teaching takeaway:** Structure in your prompt creates structure in your output. Small additions create disproportionate improvements.

**Transition to Level 3:** "But what if the stakes are even higher? What if you need output that a specialist would produce?"

### 5. Level 3: Advanced (10-15 minutes)

**Scenario setup:**
- High-stakes version — career-defining, client-facing, or strategic
- Full context about why this matters and what's at stake

**Two-part demonstration:**

#### Part A: Framework Discovery (3-5 minutes)
- Prompt AI to recommend expert frameworks for this specific task
- AI returns several options with descriptions
- Hosts discuss the options briefly
- Select one framework (pre-determined, but presented as a live choice)
- Bruce: "This is the unlock — you're not just asking AI to do the task, you're asking it to think like an expert first."
- Bower: "I picked [framework] because [practical reasoning]."

#### Part B: Framework Application (7-10 minutes)
- Walk through the framework step-by-step with AI
- Each prompt builds on the previous response
- Show the iterative, conversational process
- React to the final output quality
- Bruce: "Compare this to Level 1. Same task, same AI. The difference is entirely in how we guided it."
- Bower: "This is what I'd present to [high-stakes audience]. It's not just good for AI — it's genuinely good."

**Teaching takeaway:** When you bring expert knowledge to AI, you get expert results. The framework is the multiplier.

### 6. Wrap-up (2-3 minutes)

**What to cover:**
- Recap the progression: "We went from [Level 1 result] to [Level 3 result] using the same AI"
- Key takeaway: One sentence that captures the episode's lesson
- A4 framework reference (if it maps naturally): "This is what we call moving from Accelerate to Augment..."
- CTA: Subscribe, hit the bell, share with a colleague who'd benefit
- Next episode tease: "Next week, we're tackling [topic]..."

**Bruce's closing angle:** The mindset shift — what the viewer should think differently about after this episode
**Bower's closing angle:** The practical next step — what the viewer should go try right now

## Prompt Construction Guidelines

### Every demonstration prompt must include:

1. **Scenario header** — A brief line setting the scene: "You are a [role] at [company type]. You need to [task] for [audience] because [reason]."
2. **The actual prompt** — Complete, ready to paste, no blanks to fill
3. **Expected output note** — Brief description of what the AI will likely produce (so hosts can prepare reactions)

### Level 3 framework prompts follow this sequence:

**Prompt 3A — Framework Discovery:**
"I need to [task] for [high-stakes scenario]. Before writing anything, recommend 3-5 expert frameworks or methodologies that professionals use for [task domain]. For each, give me the name, a one-sentence description, and when it's most effective."

**Prompt 3B — Framework Selection:**
"Let's use [selected framework]. Walk me through it step by step, applying it to my specific situation: [full scenario context]. Start with [first step of framework]."

**Prompt 3C+ — Framework Steps:**
Continue the conversation, prompting AI through each step of the framework. Each prompt references the previous response and advances to the next step.

## Host Role Assignments

| Section | Bruce (Psychology/Learning) | Bower (Practical/PM) |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Hook | Sets up the emotional stakes | Grounds it in a real scenario |
| Problem Frame | Why our brains default to lazy prompting | What it costs in practice |
| Level 1 | Points out what's generic and why | When this level is actually fine |
| Level 2 | Explains why structure improves output | Shows where he'd use this at work |
| Level 3 | "This is the unlock" — the mindset shift | "This is what I'd present to..." |
| Wrap-up | What to think differently | What to go do right now |

## A4 Framework Integration Notes

**When it maps cleanly (most episodes):**
- Level 1 = Accelerate (same task, just faster)
- Level 2 = Amplify (better quality than you'd produce alone)
- Level 3 = Augment (capabilities beyond your training)
- Mention naturally in the Level 2→3 transition or during wrap-up

**When it doesn't map cleanly:**
- Skip the A4 reference entirely — don't force it
- Some tasks don't have a clean "you couldn't do this without AI" angle
- The three-level progression stands on its own

**Suggested phrasing when it does fit:**
"This is what we talk about as moving from Accelerate — where AI just does it faster — to Augment, where AI actually gives you capabilities you didn't have before. That expert framework? Most of us don't have it memorized. But AI does."
