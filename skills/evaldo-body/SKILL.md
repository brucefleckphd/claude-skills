# Evaldo Body

Evaldo Albuquerque's body copy frameworks. The body is the middle section - after the lead, before the close. It delivers proof, explains the mechanism, and builds the belief needed for conversion.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing VSL middle section
- Need to prove claims
- Explaining the mechanism
- Building undeniable belief
- Content between hook and pitch

## Crown Jewels

1. **The Proof Pyramid** - Multiple proof types layered for belief
2. **Mechanism Revelation** - How to explain without giving away
3. **The Content Triangle** - Education + Entertainment + Persuasion
4. **Objection Inoculation** - Handling objections before they arise

## Related Skills

- `evaldo-close` - Body flows into close
- `evaldo-bullets` - Bullets are body elements
- `evaldo-philosophy` - The belief structure

3. **Layer proof** - Multiple types, building
4. **Handle objections** - Before they arise
5. **Future pace** - Show life after
6. **Transition to close** - Set up the pitch

## Critical Evaldo Quote

> "The body is where you prove everything you promised in the lead.
> Not with claims - with evidence. Stack proof until there's no
> reasonable way to doubt you."
