# Evaldo Voice Patterns - Body

## Body-Specific Voice Guidance

Use this reference when writing body copy sections.

## THE EVALDO BODY VOICE

### Core Principle
The body proves everything promised in the lead. Not with claims - with evidence. Stack proof until there's no reasonable way to doubt.

### The Body Mindset
- Educate, Entertain, Persuade (all three, all the time)
- Every section earns the next
- Proof stacks like a pyramid
- Always teach toward the sale

---

## PROOF LANGUAGE

### Introducing Proof

**Strong (Specific + Credible):**
- "Here's the evidence..."
- "This Harvard study showed..."
- "When John used this..."
- "The data is undeniable..."

**Weak (Vague + Claimsy):**
- "Studies show..."
- "Research proves..."
- "Many people have..."
- "It's been proven that..."

### Stacking Proof

**Layer 1 (Authority):**
> "After 25 years managing $2 billion on Wall Street, I've seen every market condition..."

**Layer 2 (Experts):**
> "Warren Buffett calls this 'the most reliable pattern in markets'..."

**Layer 3 (Data):**
> "In 94% of cases over the last 20 years, this signal preceded major moves..."

**Layer 4 (Testimonials):**
> "Here's what John, a retired teacher, experienced..."

**Layer 5 (Peak Case):**
> "And then there's Maria - who turned $10K into $2.1 million in 18 months..."

## MECHANISM LANGUAGE

### Revealing the Mechanism

**Strong (Intriguing + Clear):**
- "I call this the [Name] Method..."
- "It works because of a simple principle..."
- "Here's what happens when you..."
- "The core insight is..."

**Weak (Technical + Complex):**
- "The algorithmic process involves..."
- "Using multivariate analysis..."
- "The proprietary system calculates..."
- "Through a complex methodology..."

### The Reveal Balance

Give enough to believe:
> "The Calendar Pattern works because major market moves follow predictable cycles tied to institutional behavior."

Not enough to do it themselves:
> (Don't explain exactly which events, which dates, which signals)

---

## TEACHING LANGUAGE

### Hook → Insight → Proof → Implication → Bridge

**Hook:**
> "Most people think success comes from picking the right stocks. They're wrong."

**Insight:**
> "Timing beats picking 94% of the time."

**Proof:**
> "This 20-year Harvard study analyzed 10,000 trades..."

**Implication:**
> "Which means you don't need to be a stock genius. You just need to know WHEN."

**Bridge:**
> "And that's exactly what the Calendar Pattern reveals..."

---

## OBJECTION INOCULATION LANGUAGE

### The Pattern

**Raise:**
> "Now, you might be thinking this sounds too good to be true..."

**Acknowledge:**
> "And honestly, I understand. I thought the same thing..."

**Reframe:**
> "But here's what I discovered..."

**Prove:**
> "Look at John's results. Look at Sarah's results. Look at the data..."

---

## TRANSITION LANGUAGE

### Between Sections

**Forward Pull:**
- "But that's not even the most interesting part..."
- "What I'm about to show you takes this further..."
- "Now here's where it really gets exciting..."

**Connection:**
- "And that leads us to..."
- "Which brings me to..."
- "Speaking of [topic]..."

### Energy Maintenance

Never let a section end flat:
> ❌ "So that's how the pattern works."
> ✓ "So that's how the pattern works. But wait until you see what happens when you combine it with the second signal..."
