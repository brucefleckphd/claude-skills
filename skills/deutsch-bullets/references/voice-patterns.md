## THE DEUTSCH BULLET VOICE

### Core Principle
Bullets start as lumps of coal. Polish iteratively until they're diamonds. Everything about copywriting is contained in bullet writing.

### The Polishing Mindset
"It's almost like polishing a diamond. Starts out as a lump of coal, and then you polish it here, you polish it here, and then it's shiny like a diamond."

## THE POLISHING SEQUENCE

### Level 1: Basic Benefit
"How to achieve financial freedom"

### Level 2: Add Specificity
"How to achieve financial freedom in as little as two weeks"

### Level 3: Add Picture
"How to be writing from the beach in Costa Rica in as little as two weeks"

### Level 4: Add Mechanism
"The little-known brain hack that could have you writing from the beach in Costa Rica in as little as two weeks"

### Level 5: Add Proof
"The little-known brain hack endorsed by Harvard University that could have you writing from the beach in Costa Rica in as little as two weeks"

## VOICE PATTERNS BY ELEMENT

### Specificity Patterns
- "In as little as [timeframe]..."
- "[Exact number] proven..."
- "On page [number]..."
- "The [specific location] secret..."

### Mechanism Patterns
- "The little-known [mechanism] that..."
- "Thanks to this [named technique]..."
- "Using the [authority-endorsed] method..."
- "The [origin] secret that..."

### Proof Patterns
- "As proven by [institution]..."
- "Endorsed by [authority]..."
- "[Number] of [people] have already..."
- "Featured in [publication]..."

### Curiosity Patterns
- "Why [counterintuitive thing] actually works..."
- "The [seemingly wrong thing] that..."
- "What [experts] don't want you to know about..."
- Hint at benefit without revealing method

### Visual Patterns
- Replace abstract with concrete
- "Costa Rica beach" not "financial freedom"
- "Playing with grandkids" not "more energy"
- Create a picture they can see

## THE PROMOTION TEST

Good bullets can become:
1. Headlines (promote strongest bullets)
2. Body copy (expand bullets into paragraphs)
3. Email subject lines
4. Ad hooks

If a bullet is strong enough, it works everywhere.
