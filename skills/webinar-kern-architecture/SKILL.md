# Kern Architecture Frameworks

Foundation frameworks for webinar campaign structure, funnel flow, and strategic planning.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a complete webinar campaign from registration to post-webinar
- Understanding Kern's 5-phase webinar structure
- Mapping out A-to-Z funnel flow with indoctrination and reminder sequences
- Diagnosing which part of your funnel is underperforming
- Deciding between hybrid vs. automated vs. fully live webinar models
- Learning Kern's philosophical approach (help first, sell second)

## Frameworks Included (13)

### Master Systems (Ace/King)
- **K1. Five-Phase Webinar Structure** - Confirmation → Difference → Bond → Payoff → Offer
- **K2. Webinar Mission Statement** - Help genuinely, earn trust, foster relationships, make sales (in that order)
- **K3. Webinar Campaign Process Map** - Complete 7-phase campaign: Recon → Registration → Liquidator → Indoctrination → Reminder → Webinar → Post-Webinar

### Core Frameworks (Queen/Jack)
- **K4. A-to-Z Webinar Funnel Flow** - Complete campaign architecture from traffic to purchase
- **K5. Situation-Solution Diagnostic Framework** - Problem diagnosis and proven solution mapping
- **K6. Recon Worksheet Three-Question Framework** - Top 3 desires, WHY they want them, objections
- **K7. Hybrid Webinar Model Rationale** - Pre-recorded presentation + Live Q&A = best of both worlds
- **K8. Webinar Mission Statement (5 Goals)** - Build responsive list, create liquidator, establish trust, genuinely help, post-webinar sequence

### Supporting Frameworks (10)
- **K9. Goodwill-to-Income Principle** - Bank balance proportional to goodwill × offers made
- **K10. Bag of Tricks Problem-Solving Method** - Lookup table for matching situations to proven solutions
- **K11. Overwhelm Prevention System** - Chunk everything into 5-15 minute pieces
- **K12. Big Picture Process Map** - Visual map of complete Blueprint flow with decision branches
- **K13. Revenue Benchmark Context** - $608K average campaign context for expectations

## How to Use

1. **Start with Philosophy** - Use K2 (Mission Statement) to understand Kern's "help first" approach
2. **Do Your Recon** - Use K6 (Three Questions) to understand desires, motivations, and objections
3. **Map Your Campaign** - Use K3 (Process Map) or K4 (A-to-Z Flow) to plan complete funnel
4. **Choose Your Model** - Use K7 (Hybrid Rationale) to decide presentation approach
5. **Structure Your Webinar** - Use K1 (Five Phases) to organize presentation flow
6. **Diagnose Problems** - Use K5 (Situation-Solution) to troubleshoot underperforming elements
7. **Build Sections** - Move to section-specific element skills

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Core Architecture Principle

**Five phases, help-first philosophy:**

```
CONFIRMATION (5 min)    DIFFERENCE (5 min)     BOND (10 min)
Confirm right decision  Address skepticism     Build rapport
Introduce yourself      State who it's NOT for Personal story
Sell staying           Handle doubt           Connection

PAYOFF (30-40 min)     OFFER (20-30 min)
Genuinely teach        Make the sale
Deliver value          12-step structure
Help by helping        Address objections

PHILOSOPHY: Help First → Trust Second → Sales Third
```

## Kern's Diagnostic Map

**When something's not working:**

```
PROBLEM                 SOLUTION CATEGORY
No registrations    →   Traffic, PPC, email, page copy/layout
Nobody showing up   →   Reminder sequence, indoctrination, overcome skepticism
Not enough sales    →   Post-webinar sequence, 5-phase structure, objection handling
Tech overwhelm      →   Simplified tools: LeadPages, Unbounce, GTW backdoor
Writer's block      →   Templates, process map, chunked learning
```
