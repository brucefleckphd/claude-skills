# Hormozi SPCL Content Audit

## Context

### User Story / Core Objective
A content creator or business owner is publishing content but not seeing it translate to influence or revenue. They may have views but low engagement, or followers but no conversions. They need to audit their content against the SPCL framework to identify gaps in authority-building and create a balanced content plan.

### Key Definition
> **Influence = High likelihood of compliance with a request**

When you ask someone to watch another video, subscribe, buy something, book a call, or share with a friend... how likely are they to do it?

Influence is domain-specific. You might have high influence in business advice, low influence in fashion tips.

### The SPCL Framework

| Element | Definition | How It's Built |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **S** - Status | Control over scarce resources | Money, access, connections, opportunities |
| **P** - Power | Say-do correspondence | Give advice → They follow → Good happens |
| **C** - Credibility | Third-party validation | Awards, press, testimonials, visible proof |
| **L** - Likeness | Similarity to audience | Appearance, values, voice, background |

**All four compound together.** Status alone = some influence. All four = maximum influence.

## Prioritization Rubric

### P0 — Safety / Critical Path
These MUST be completed correctly or the skill fails entirely:

1. **MANDATORY: Collect Actual Platform Data FIRST** — Before scoring ANYTHING:
   - [ ] **Instagram:** Fetch profile via browser, screenshot last 12-20 posts, extract captions
   - [ ] **Facebook:** Fetch page/profile via browser, screenshot recent posts, extract content
   - [ ] **LinkedIn:** Fetch profile, screenshot recent posts, extract content
   - [ ] **YouTube:** Check channel, note video count, recent video titles
   - [ ] **Twitter/X:** Fetch profile if active, screenshot recent tweets

   **⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED without at least 2 platforms audited with REAL content.**
   **⚠️ Voice DNA files alone are NOT sufficient - they don't contain actual post content.**

   If browser access fails, ASK USER to provide:
   - Screenshots of last 20 posts from each platform
   - Or paste recent post captions/content
   - Or export from platform (Instagram data download, etc.)

2. **All 4 SPCL Elements Scored** — Must assess Status, Power, Credibility, AND Likeness

3. **Lowest Element Identified** — Must determine which element is the priority focus

4. **Content Audit Performed** — Must review recent content against SPCL, not just self-assessment
   - **This means ACTUAL POSTS, not profile descriptions**
   - Score each of last 20 posts against SPCL elements
   - If you don't have posts to score, the audit is incomplete

5. **Actionable Plan Created** — Must result in specific content types to create, not just insights

### P1 — Feature Completeness
These should be included for a complete deliverable:

1. **Status Assessment** — What scarce resources controlled, how demonstrated in content

2. **Power Assessment** — Say-do cycles documented, testimonials of advice followed + results

3. **Credibility Assessment** — Third-party validation inventory, visibility in content

4. **Likeness Assessment** — Match scoring across dimensions (age, values, background, style)

5. **Total SPCL Score** — Calculated out of 40 with interpretation

6. **Content Audit (Last 20 Pieces)** — Scored against SPCL

7. **Content Type Strategy** — Which content types build which SPCL element

8. **Platform Strategy** — Long-form vs short-form prioritization

9. **Volume Assessment** — Current output vs benchmarks

10. **90-Day Content Plan** — Focus element, volume commitment, weekly SPCL balance

### P2 — Polish / Edge Cases
Nice-to-have refinements:

1. **Content Idea Templates** — Specific prompts for each SPCL element

2. **Platform Priority List** — Customized to their situation

3. **Competitor Analysis** — How competitors score on SPCL

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Status Assessment

**What Scarce Resources Do You Control?**

| Resource Type | What You Have | Score (1-10) |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Money/Wealth | | |
| Access to people/opportunities | | |
| Knowledge/Expertise | | |
| Time/Attention | | |
| Physical assets | | |
| Network/Connections | | |

**How Is Status Demonstrated in Content?**
- [ ] Results are visible (revenue, metrics, outcomes)
- [ ] Lifestyle shown (office, team, environment)
- [ ] Access demonstrated (who you know, where you go)
- [ ] Scarcity created (limited spots, exclusive access)

**Status Score: ___/10**

### Step 2: Power Assessment

**Power = Say-Do Correspondence**

> "If I say do X, you do X, and a good thing happens... I have power over you."

**More cycles = More power**

This is why parents have maximum influence—thousands of say-do cycles over years.

**Your Say-Do Cycles:**

| Advice You've Given | People Who Followed | Results They Got |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| | | |

**How Is Power Demonstrated in Content?**
- [ ] Testimonials showing people followed advice + got results
- [ ] Case studies with before/after
- [ ] Implementation content (not just theory)
- [ ] "I told them to do X, here's what happened"
- [ ] Follow-up stories on past advice

**Power Score: ___/10**

### Step 3: Credibility Assessment

**Third-Party Validation Inventory:**

| Credibility Type | What You Have | Visible in Content? |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Awards/Recognition | | Yes / No |
| Media features | | Yes / No |
| Certifications | | Yes / No |
| Published books/articles | | Yes / No |
| Speaking engagements | | Yes / No |
| Client testimonials | | Yes / No |
| Industry metrics | | Yes / No |
| Partnerships/endorsements | | Yes / No |

**How Is Credibility Demonstrated in Content?**
- [ ] Proof visible in video backgrounds
- [ ] Metrics stated in intros
- [ ] Testimonials featured regularly
- [ ] Third-party logos displayed
- [ ] Results verified by external sources

**Credibility Score: ___/10**

### Step 4: Likeness Assessment

**Similarity to Your Target Audience:**

| Dimension | Your Profile | Target Audience | Match (1-10) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Age range | | | |
| Gender | | | |
| Background/Origin | | | |
| Values | | | |
| Speaking style | | | |
| Appearance | | | |
| Struggles experienced | | | |
| Current lifestyle | | | |

**How Is Likeness Demonstrated in Content?**
- [ ] Shared background stories ("I used to be where you are")
- [ ] Relatable struggles mentioned
- [ ] Accessible language (not too fancy)
- [ ] Authentic personality (not corporate)
- [ ] "I'm just like you but further along"

**Likeness Score: ___/10**

### Step 5: Calculate Total SPCL Score

| Element | Score (1-10) |
|---------|--------------|
| **S** - Status | |
| **P** - Power | |
| **C** - Credibility | |
| **L** - Likeness | |
| **TOTAL** | /40 |

**Score Interpretation:**
- **30-40:** Strong influence. Focus on consistency and volume.
- **20-30:** Moderate influence. Fill the gaps.
- **10-20:** Building phase. Major work needed on weakest elements.
- **0-10:** Starting from scratch. Pick one element to focus on.

**Lowest Scoring Element: _______** ← This is the priority focus

### Step 6: Content Audit (Last 20 Pieces)

Review last 20 pieces of content and score each:

| Content | S | P | C | L | Total |
|---------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| 1. | | | | | |
| 2. | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | |
| 20. | | | | | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- 0 = Not present
- 1 = Weakly present
- 2 = Clearly present

**Most underrepresented element in content:** _______________

### Step 7: Content Type Strategy

**Content Types by SPCL Element:**

| Element | Content Types That Build It |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Status** | Results/metrics posts, Lifestyle content, "Day in my life," Behind-the-scenes of business |
| **Power** | How-to tutorials, Implementation guides, "Do this exact thing," Challenges, Follow-up on past advice |
| **Credibility** | Case studies, Testimonial features, Media mention reposts, Awards/recognition |
| **Likeness** | Origin stories, Failure stories, Relatable struggles, Personal opinions, Authentic personality |

### Step 8: Platform Strategy

**Long-Form vs. Short-Form:**

> "2 hours of long-form content = 480 short-form videos for influence building"

- **Long-form builds power** (more say-do cycles per piece)
- **Short-form builds awareness** (more reach, less depth)

**Recommended Platform Priority:**

| Platform | Format | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| YouTube (long) | 15-60 min | Primary influence building |
| Podcast | 30-90 min | Deep trust building |
| YouTube (shorts) | 15-60 sec | Awareness → Long |
| Instagram/TikTok | 15-60 sec | Awareness → Long |
| LinkedIn | Written posts | Status + Credibility |
| Twitter/X | Short takes | Personality + Likeness |
| Email | Mixed | Direct relationship |
| Live streams | Unlimited | Maximum trust (raw, unedited) |

### Step 9: Volume Assessment

**Current Output:**

| Platform | Content/Week | Content/Month | Content/Year |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| | | | |
| **Total** | | | |

**Benchmark Comparison:**
- Hormozi: 35,000 pieces/year (~96/day)
- Large influencers: 3-5/day
- Active creators: 1-3/day
- Minimum viable: 1/day

### Step 10: Build 90-Day Content Plan

**Focus Element:** _______________ (the lowest scoring)

**Volume Commitment:** _____ pieces per week

**Platform Commitment:**
- Primary: _______________
- Secondary: _______________

**Weekly SPCL Balance:**
- Status content: _____ pieces
- Power content: _____ pieces
- Credibility content: _____ pieces
- Likeness content: _____ pieces

That's the truest measure of power/influence building.

---

## Required Inputs

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Must collect LIVE platform data before proceeding.**

To run an SPCL content audit, you MUST collect:

### Step 0: Fetch Live Platform Data (DO THIS FIRST)
1. **Use browser tools** to visit each active platform:
   - Instagram: `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate` → screenshot → `read_page` or `get_page_text`
   - Facebook: Same process
   - LinkedIn: Same process
   - YouTube: Same process
   - Twitter/X: Same process

2. **For each platform, capture:**
   - Follower/subscriber count
   - Post frequency (how often posting?)
   - Last 12-20 post captions/content
   - Engagement metrics if visible (likes, comments, shares)
   - Content themes/types being posted

3. **If browser access fails**, ask user to provide:
   - Screenshots of recent posts
   - Copy/paste of recent captions
   - Platform data export
   - Or manual description of last 20 posts

### Then collect:
4. Voice DNA files (supplementary, NOT primary source)
5. Engagement metrics from platform analytics
6. Conversion data from content (if available)
7. Target audience profile

---

## Outputs Delivered

1. SPCL Scorecard (individual and total)
2. Content Gap Analysis
3. 90-Day Content Calendar
4. Content Templates for Each Element
5. Platform Priority List
6. Volume Recommendation
7. Weekly SPCL Balance Guide

---

## Verification Step

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Run this checklist BEFORE delivering the audit.**

### Data Collection Verification (MUST PASS ALL)
- [ ] **Instagram audited?** — Visited live profile, captured last 12-20 posts with captions
- [ ] **Facebook audited?** — Visited live page/profile, captured recent posts
- [ ] **LinkedIn audited?** — Visited live profile, captured recent posts
- [ ] **YouTube checked?** — Verified channel exists, noted video count and themes
- [ ] **At least 2 platforms have ACTUAL POST DATA** (not just profile descriptions)

**If any platform was skipped or inaccessible:**
- [ ] Asked user to provide screenshots or content export
- [ ] Documented which platforms could not be audited and why
- [ ] Flagged the audit as "PARTIAL" if missing key platforms

### Analysis Verification
- [ ] Are all 4 SPCL elements scored (not just discussed)?
- [ ] Is the lowest-scoring element clearly identified as priority?
- [ ] Was recent content actually audited (not assumed)?
- [ ] Were at least 12 REAL posts scored against SPCL matrix?
- [ ] Does the 90-day plan include specific content types for the weak element?
- [ ] Is there a volume commitment (not just "post more")?

### Common Failure Modes to Avoid
- ❌ Scoring SPCL based only on Voice DNA files (no actual posts)
- ❌ Assuming content themes without seeing actual posts
- ❌ Skipping platforms without asking user for data
- ❌ Delivering audit without flagging missing platform data
