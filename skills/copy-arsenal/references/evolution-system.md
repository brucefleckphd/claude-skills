# Evolution System - How Skills Improve Over Time

## The Core Concept

The Copy Arsenal is not a static tool. It learns from every competition, every judgment, and every user override. Over time, it becomes optimized for YOUR specific projects, markets, and preferences.

---

## Three Levels of Evolution

### Level 1: Within an Arena

Each round of competition produces learning:
- What the winner did differently
- What the critics flagged
- What the judge valued most
- What the user overrode

This learning informs the next round immediately. By round 3, all entries are significantly better than round 1.

### Level 2: After an Arena

The Skill Evolver runs post-competition:
1. Collects all learning from all rounds
2. Detects patterns across the entire competition
3. Proposes or applies skill updates
4. Updates win records

**Minor updates (auto-applied):**
- Adding clarifications to existing frameworks
- Reinforcing patterns that won
- Adding examples from winning entries

**Major updates (require your approval):**
- New frameworks based on winning patterns
- Structural changes to skill workflows
- Paradigm shifts in approach

### Level 3: Across Multiple Arenas

Over time, patterns emerge:
- "Clayton wins for health supplement copy 73% of the time"
- "Deutsch wins for educated audiences above $500 price point"
- "Carlton hooks outperform all others for email subject lines"
- "Synthesis with Deutsch primary + Carlton hooks wins cold outreach"

These patterns are tracked in the Learning Ledger and used to improve future recommendations.

## What Gets Tracked

### Win Records (Per Copywriter)
- Total wins and losses
- Win rate by project type
- Win rate by audience type
- Head-to-head records against other copywriters
- Learning accumulated from losses
- Skill evolution history

### Learning Ledger (Global)
- Active copywriter stable
- Spawned copywriters and their lineage
- Arena run history with all results
- Pattern detection queue
- Synthesis lineage tree
- Cross-arena learning

### Synthesis Registry
- `successful/` - Combinations that became permanent copywriters
- `attempted/` - All combinations tried (for learning what works)

## The Evolution Cycle

```
Run Arena
    |
Competitions produce wins/losses
    |
Wins/losses produce learning
    |
Learning produces skill updates
    |
Updated skills compete better
    |
Better competition produces deeper learning
    |
[cycle continues]
```

## Copywriter Spawning

The most powerful form of evolution: creating entirely new copywriters.

**Trigger:** A synthesis combination wins ALL rounds of an Arena.

**Process:**
1. Copywriter Spawner is invoked
2. You choose a name for the new methodology
3. The winning combination formula is extracted
4. New skill folder is created with SKILL.md
5. New critic agent is created
6. Win records are initialized
7. New copywriter joins the stable
8. It competes in future Arenas alongside the original four

**Lineage tracking:**
Every spawned copywriter knows its parents:
> "Practitioner Persuasion = David Deutsch (48%) + John Carlton (22%) + Clayton Makepeace (22%) + Evaldo Albuquerque (8%)"

**Example:** `practitioner-persuasion` was spawned from a synthesis that won all rounds in a Health Practitioner Cold Email Arena. It combined Deutsch's resistance-free voice with Carlton's hook power, Clayton's proof systems, and Evaldo's belief architecture.

## Your Advantage Grows Over Time

| Timeline | System State |
|----------|-------------|
| Month 1 | Initial skills, fresh system |
| Month 3 | Win patterns emerging, first skill updates |
| Month 6 | System optimized for your markets, spawned copywriters competing |
| Year 1 | Fully customized system with deep learning across many project types |

**The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes.**

## Skill Evolver Rules

The Skill Evolver follows strict rules to prevent degradation:

1. **Minor updates auto-apply** - Clarifications, examples, reinforcement
2. **Major updates require approval** - New frameworks, structural changes
3. **Last 3 versions maintained** - Rollback available if an update hurts performance
4. **Cross-arena patterns require 3+ data points** - No knee-jerk updates from single results
5. **User overrides carry extra weight** - Your judgment calibrates the system faster

---

## Incremental Save Protocol

Learning is saved AFTER EVERY MATCH, not at the end of a tournament. This protects against context loss:

1. Match completes -> Ledger updated immediately
2. Win records updated immediately
3. Key learnings logged immediately
4. Skill updates proposed/applied immediately

**This ensures no learning is ever lost.**
