# Workflow Selection Guide

## Three Paths to Great Copy

### Path 1: Single Master (Speed Priority)

**Use when:** You know which approach fits your project.

**How:** Invoke the master skill directly.

```
/clayton    - Full Clayton workflow
/carlton    - Full Carlton workflow
/deutsch    - Full Deutsch workflow
/evaldo     - Full Evaldo workflow
```

**What happens:**
1. Research & strategy phase
2. Structure planning
3. Full draft
4. Silent critic review (automatic)
5. Revision based on critic feedback
6. Final polished output

**Time:** Single pass, fastest option.

### Path 2: Element Skill (Surgical Fix)

**Use when:** You have existing copy that needs one section improved.

**How:** Invoke the specific element skill.

**By copy section:**

| Need | Options |
|------|---------|
| Better headlines | `clayton-headlines`, `carlton-headlines`, `deutsch-headlines`, `evaldo-headlines` |
| Better opening/lead | `clayton-leads`, `carlton-leads`, `deutsch-leads`, `evaldo-leads` |
| Better bullets | `clayton-bullets`, `carlton-bullets`, `deutsch-bullets`, `evaldo-bullets` |
| Better body copy | `clayton-body-copy`, `carlton-body`, `deutsch-body`, `evaldo-body` |
| Better close | `clayton-closes`, `carlton-close`, `deutsch-close`, `evaldo-close` |
| Better proof | `clayton-proof` |
| Better offers | `clayton-offers`, `carlton-offers` |
| Better hooks | `carlton-hooks` |
| Better stories | `deutsch-stories` |
| Better voice | `carlton-voice` |

**By special need:**

| Need | Skill |
|------|-------|
| Email campaign | `clayton-email` |
| Event copy | `clayton-events` |
| Feature-to-benefit translation | `carlton-features-benefits` |
| Testimonial improvement | `carlton-testimonials` |
| Urgency/scarcity | `carlton-turbulence` |
| Core idea/angle development | `evaldo-ideas` |
| Lift notes/supplementary emails | `evaldo-lifts` |
| Market research | `carlton-research` |
| Copy testing plan | `clayton-testing` |

### Path 3: Arena Competition (Quality Priority)

**Use when:** Maximum quality matters more than speed.

**How:**
```
/arena [project-name] [rounds]

Example: /arena landing-page 3
```

**What happens per round:**
1. All 5 entries drafted in parallel (4 masters + synthesis)
2. Each entry critiqued by its methodology's critic
3. Each entry revised based on critic feedback
4. Marketplace Judge evaluates all entries
5. Winner declared (with user override option)
6. Learning integrated for all competitors
7. Next round begins with accumulated learning

**Recommended rounds:**
- 3 rounds: Standard competition
- 5 rounds: Maximum refinement
- 1 round: Quick comparison (no evolution)
