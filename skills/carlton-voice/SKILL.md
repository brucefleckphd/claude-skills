# Carlton Voice - Step 9 of the Simple Writing System

"This is the Million Dollar Step. The way to becoming the go-to guy in your niche."

## When to Use This Skill

- Developing your unique copywriting voice
- Writing in Carlton's bar room conversation style
- Creating compelling origin stories
- Establishing go-to guy positioning
- Building voice-driven marketing

## The Voice Philosophy

### Why Voice Matters

> "To stand out from the mob, a lot depends on if people buy into your story."

Voice isn't decoration. It's the foundation of:
- Trust (they feel they know you)
- Differentiation (you stand out)
- Connection (they relate to you)
- Authority (they believe you)

### Write In Your Own Voice

**Critical rule:** Don't try to copy the writing style of an accomplished copywriter. If you're a beginner, you're just setting up an extra hill to climb.

Writing in your own style makes the copy come across better in every way.

## The Bar Room Conversation Test

### What It Means

Write like you're explaining something to a friend in a bar.

**Characteristics:**
- Casual but not sloppy
- Direct but not abrupt
- Conversational but compelling
- Personal but professional
- Confident but not arrogant

### How To Achieve It

1. **Speak before you write** - Record yourself explaining, then transcribe
2. **Read aloud** - If it sounds stiff, rewrite
3. **Drop adjectives** - Hemingway's technique for natural flow
4. **Use contractions** - "you're" not "you are", "don't" not "do not"
5. **Include verbal expressions** - "Look...", "Here's the thing...", "I gotta tell you..."

---

## First Person Requirements

### The Rule

By the close, they should feel like they know you.

**Always use:**
- "I" not "we" (unless you're specifically a team)
- "my" not "our"
- Personal stories and opinions
- Direct address to the reader ("you")

### Why First Person Works

- Creates intimacy
- Builds trust through transparency
- Feels like real conversation
- Easier to be authentic

**Exception:** If you genuinely ARE a team, "we" is fine. But don't use "we" to hide behind corporate speak.

---

## Storytelling Framework

### The 3-Element Story Structure

Every good story has:

1. **Setup** - Establish the situation, character, problem
2. **Plot** - The twist, discovery, action
3. **Punchline** - The result, lesson, payoff

**Example structure:**
> **Setup:** "I was broke, clueless, and desperate..."
> **Plot:** "Then I discovered [thing] and everything changed..."
> **Punchline:** "Now I [result], and you can too."

### We're Hardwired For Stories

Humans are hardwired as a species to listen to stories. Use this.

**Carlton's advice:** Read his blog post "You, The Movie" - think of your life as a movie where stuff is always happening.

---

## Iconic Situation Templates

Stories that become larger than life, almost mythical:

### 1. Hometown Boy Makes Good
The local kid who went out and conquered the world.

### 2. Loser Learns To Win
Transformation from failure to success.

### 3. Clueless Dude Gets A Clue
The awakening, the moment of insight.

### 4. Outsider Sneaks Inside
Breaking into the exclusive club.

### 5. Regular Guy Discovers Secrets of Exceptionality
The everyman who found the key.

### 6. David Defeats Goliath
The underdog victory.

### 7. Accidental Discovery
Stumbled onto something huge.

### 8. Against All Odds
Overcame impossible obstacles.

---

## Creating Your Iconic Situation

### Elements to Develop

**Visual Element:**
- Something easily recognizable
- An image that represents your story
- A scene people can picture

**Transformation:**
- Clear before/after
- Specific turning point
- Relatable journey

**Larger Than Life:**
- Not just facts, but meaning
- Mythical quality
- Universal truth embedded

### The "You, The Movie" Exercise

Think about your life as a movie:
- What's the inciting incident?
- Who's the antagonist?
- What's the transformation?
- What's the iconic visual people will remember?

---

## Specificity Over Generality

### The Carlton Rule

Never say general when you can say specific.

**General (boring):**
> "I'm a parent."

**Specific (interesting):**
> "I'm a parent with three children. One in jail and two in kindergarten."

### Why Specificity Works

- Keeps attention
- Creates believability
- Shows you're real
- Makes you memorable

### The Specific Details Test

For any claim or description:
- Can you add a number?
- Can you add a name?
- Can you add a place?
- Can you add a timeframe?
- Can you add a quirky detail?

---

## No Throat Clearing

### The Problem

Beginners spend too much time "clearing their throat" at the beginning of copy - warming up, introducing, explaining context.

### Carlton's Practice

> "I often cut out the first paragraph or even first page of my ads just before my final draft, realizing what I had written really wasn't all that important."

### The Old Direct Mail Rule

> "Direct mail firms take the first two pages of an ad a copywriter gives them and crumple them up."

### The Fix

Start where the ACTION is. If you could delete your first paragraph and the piece would be stronger, delete it.

---

## Avoid "Deadline" Copy

### What It Is

Copy that feels dead, zombie-like, lifeless.

### How To Avoid It

1. **Inject motivation/self-help:**
   > "Remember this day. Your life is going to be different from this day forward."

2. **Make it an experience:**
   - Not just information transfer
   - An event in their life
   - Something they'll remember

3. **Wake them up:**
   - Challenge them
   - Surprise them
   - Move them emotionally

---

## Establishing Credibility

### The Go-To Guy Position

Establish - truthfully and forcefully but without hype - why you're THE Go-To Guy in this situation.

**Remember:**
- He's in some kind of pain
- He's skeptical and ready to bolt
- He will NOT put up with bragging
- You must win him over on HIS terms, immediately

### Credibility Elements

1. **Story** - How you became the expert
2. **Results** - What you've achieved
3. **Recognition** - Who else respects you
4. **Skin in the game** - Why you care
5. **Insider status** - What you know that others don't

---

## Voice Development Exercise

### Handwrite Old Direct Mail Ads

Carlton's #1 recommendation for developing voice:

> "Handwrite old direct mail ads. You internalize the rhythm of the words."

> "I don't know anything that correlates to the guys who are really good at it more than that."

### Why Handwriting Works

- Muscle memory embeds patterns
- Forces you to slow down
- You feel the rhythm
- Patterns become instinctive

### How To Do It

1. Find classic direct mail ads (Halbert, Carlton, Makepeace)
2. Handwrite the entire ad, word for word
3. Do this regularly (weekly)
4. Eventually, the patterns become yours

---

## Mandatory Workflow

### Step 1: Define Your Authentic Voice
Ask yourself:
- How do I naturally talk to friends?
- What's my conversational style?
- What expressions do I use?
- What's my natural energy level?

### Step 2: Develop Your Story
Using iconic situation templates:
- What's your transformation?
- What's your iconic visual?
- What's your "movie" storyline?

### Step 3: Write First Draft
- Write as you speak
- Don't edit as you go
- Get it all out

### Step 4: Bar Room Test
Read aloud and check:
- [ ] Would this sound natural in a bar?
- [ ] Is it first person?
- [ ] Are there specifics instead of generalities?
- [ ] Is there throat clearing to cut?

### Step 5: Cut Throat Clearing
- Delete any warming-up paragraphs
- Start where the action is
- Check if cutting first paragraph helps

### Step 6: Voice Polish
- [ ] Add verbal expressions
- [ ] Use contractions
- [ ] Inject personality
- [ ] Make it an experience

## Advanced Voice Frameworks

### The "Chops and Chutzpah" Formula

Great copy requires BOTH:
1. **Chops** - Real substance, honest worth, genuine value
2. **Chutzpah** - Personality, audacity, willingness to be bold

**The Balance:**
- Chops without chutzpah = boring, forgettable
- Chutzpah without chops = hype, unbelievable
- Both together = memorable AND credible

### The "Passionate Reason" Technique

When you're genuinely passionate about your product:
- **DON'T** bowl over the reader with enthusiasm
- **DO** contain your passion with a "gleam in the eye"

**Pattern:**
> "Look, I could go on all day about this, but let me just tell you the one thing that really blew my mind..."

The reader sees your passion but isn't overwhelmed by it.

### "Speaking Their Language" Framework

Your copy should melt seamlessly into the conversation already happening in your prospect's head.

**How to achieve it:**
1. Use the exact words they use to describe their problem
2. Match their vocabulary level
3. Reference their inside jokes/knowledge
4. Address their specific fears in their words

**Test:** If they forwarded your email to a friend, would the friend recognize it as something from "their world"?

### Virtual Scene Creation

Describe your product or service so enticingly that ALL target groups can imagine themselves enjoying it.

**Process:**
1. Identify 3-5 different prospect types
2. For each, write a mini-scene of them using/enjoying the product
3. Include sensory details (what they see, feel, hear)
4. Make the scene specific enough to be real, universal enough to apply

**Example:**
> "Picture yourself on the 18th hole, your buddies watching. You take your stance, feel that perfect coil building, and unleash... The ball sails 280 yards dead center. Their jaws drop. They want to know your secret."

### The "It's Not Your Fault" Technique

For behavioral change pitches (diet, habits, skills), use this pattern:

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge they've struggled
2. Explain why it's NOT their fault (bad info, wrong methods)
3. Reveal the REAL cause of their failure
4. Position your solution as the answer

**Template:**
> "If you've tried [method] and failed, here's something important: It's not your fault. You were probably taught [common wrong approach]. The truth is [real insight]. That's why [your solution] works..."

**Warning:** This only works if you can legitimately explain WHY their past failures weren't their fault. Never use it as empty manipulation.
