# Joon Transition Frameworks

Peng Joon's approach to transitioning from teaching to selling - seeding throughout content, price marinating for high-ticket, and hook-story-offer structure.

## When to Use This Skill
- Creating the bridge from teaching to upsell
- Seeding offers during content (not just at the end)
- High-ticket offers ($10K+) requiring price marinade
- Positioning upsells as "next step" not "more stuff"

## Core Philosophy
"When you are doing your event, you want to be seeding for your upsells so that when you do your upsells, it becomes a whole lot easier by introducing what your upsells are as part of your content as early as possible."

## Frameworks Included (3)

### Tier 1 (Foundational)
1. Seeding for Upsells Through Content
2. Hook-Story-Offer for Upsell Positioning

### Tier 2 (Intermediate)
3. High-Ticket Price Marinade (Weighing Scale)

## Framework Details

### 1. Seeding for Upsells Through Content
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**Strategy:**
Introduce upsell products casually during teaching as examples, not pitches.

**Steps:**
1. Identify upsells you'll offer at end
2. Introduce them in first hour as teaching examples
3. Show actual product/funnel/price while teaching
4. Example: "This is my $5000 program funnel" (teaching funnels, but seeding $5K price)
5. Repeat mentions throughout event

**Why It Works:**
- Establishes price point in minds early
- Allows time to marinade on value
- They see results/testimonials throughout
- Makes close easier - already familiar with offer

**Example:** "Teaching funnels → 'This is one of my funnels selling $5K program' → establishes price"

### 2. Hook-Story-Offer for Upsell Positioning
**Tier:** 1 (Foundational)

**The Structure:**
```
HOOK → Create curiosity about next logical step
  ↓
STORY → Share personal story demonstrating opportunity
  ↓
OFFER → Present vehicle to achieve that opportunity
```

**Key Principle:** Good upsell = NEXT thing, not more advanced thing.

**Steps:**
1. Teach "what's next" before upsell (not more of same)
2. Hook: Create curiosity about next logical step
3. Story: Share personal story demonstrating opportunity
4. Offer: Present the vehicle to achieve that

**Example:** Tony Robbins Mastery University story → opportunity of speaking → Platform Closing offer

**Critical:** They should never feel you held back content to create upsell.

### 3. High-Ticket Price Marinade (Weighing Scale)
**Tier:** 2 (Intermediate)

**The Principle:**
For high-ticket ($10K+), introduce price FIRST then spend rest of event balancing scale with value.

**Visual:**
```
LOW-TICKET APPROACH:
Value Value Value → Price Reveal → Scale tips toward value ✓

HIGH-TICKET APPROACH:
WRONG: Value Value Value → $20K Reveal → Scale tips (shock) ✗
RIGHT: $20K Reveal Early → Value Value Value → Scale balances ✓
```

**Why It Works:**
- Early price reveal allows time to justify
- Late price reveal on high-ticket creates sticker shock
- Time heals sticker shock if given early

**How to Apply:**
1. State high-ticket price early in event
2. Visualize weighing scale with price on one side
3. Spend rest of event adding value to balance

**Joon's Insight:** "If you introduce the price first, $20,000, and now you have the rest of the event to balance it out with constant value, it constantly balances back out."

## How to Use These Frameworks

**For Standard Upsells:**
1. Seed offer mentions during teaching (Framework 1)
2. Use hook-story-offer structure (Framework 2)
3. Position as "next step" not "more advanced"

**For High-Ticket ($10K+):**
1. Reveal price early in event
2. Spend rest of event building value
3. By close, scale is balanced

**Integration with Close:**
These frameworks SET UP the close. They don't replace the close frameworks.

## Critical Reminders

1. **Seed early** - Don't wait until pitch to introduce price/offer
2. **Next step, not more** - Upsell is what comes after, not deeper on same thing
3. **Price marinade for high-ticket** - The higher the price, the earlier the reveal
4. **Never feel like holdback** - They shouldn't think you withheld content
5. **Connect story to them** - Your success story must give them hope

*"What do you teach before the upsell? What's next. A good upsell is not more advanced stuff of the same thing. A good upsell is always what is the next logical thing to do now that you have learned this?"* — Peng Joon
