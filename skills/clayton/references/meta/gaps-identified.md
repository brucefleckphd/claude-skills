## Notes on Source Material

Many gaps exist because Clayton's source material pre-dates:
- Modern social media (Facebook ads, Instagram)
- Video-first platforms (YouTube, TikTok)
- Chat-based marketing
- AI/automation tools

**Recommendation**: Supplement Clayton frameworks with modern channel-specific materials while preserving core psychology and principles, which remain timeless.

## Cross-Reference: What Clayton Would Say

Based on his principles, Clayton's likely approach to modern channels:

| Modern Channel | Apply These Clayton Principles |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Facebook Ads | Direct Benefit Paradox, Curiosity Creation |
| YouTube Ads | First 5 Seconds = Headline Maxims |
| Email Sequences | Drip Architecture still applies |
| Landing Pages | 12-Step System adapted |
| Chatbots | Conversation Copy principles |

**The psychology frameworks (86) are channel-agnostic and apply universally.**
