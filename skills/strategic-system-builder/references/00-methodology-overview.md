# The Strategic Builder Methodology

## For Entrepreneurs Building Business Systems with AI

## What This Is

This is a complete methodology for strategic entrepreneurs who want to build business systems using AI coding assistants like Claude Code.

It answers the question: **How does someone who thinks strategically -- not a coder, but a builder -- approach AI-assisted system development?**

The methodology is built on first principles and refined through practice. It bridges the gap between strategic thinking and technical execution.

## The Core Insight

Between your vision and working code, there are five levels of translation. Most people see only the top and bottom -- Vision and Implementation -- and try to jump between them.

This is why AI-assisted building feels inconsistent. The AI is being asked to do translation work it wasn't designed for.

The solution: Make the invisible levels visible. Document each level. Move through them in sequence.

## The Framework Summary

### The Translation Stack

| Level | What Lives Here | Document Type |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Vision | The transformed state | Vision Document |
| Architecture | The system of systems | System Architecture Map |
| Capability | What each piece does | Capability Map |
| Specification | How it performs the job | PRD |
| Implementation | The code itself | CLAUDE.md |

**Rule:** Never skip a level. Each level translates the one above it.

### The Three Questions Protocol

| Order | Question | When Asked |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | What's the system? | Once at start; when strategy shifts |
| 2 | What must it do? | For each major component |
| 3 | How exactly? | Before each build session |

**Rule:** Don't answer Question 3 until you've answered Questions 1 and 2.

## The Documents

### 1. Vision Document
**Purpose:** Define the transformed state
**When:** Once per major initiative
**Key test:** Can someone understand the goal without knowing the implementation?

### 2. System Architecture Map
**Purpose:** Show all systems and their relationships
**When:** At the start; updated when strategy shifts
**Key test:** Can someone see how all pieces fit together?

### 3. Capability Map
**Purpose:** Define what a system must be able to DO
**When:** Once per system
**Key test:** Can each capability be implemented multiple ways?

### 4. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
**Purpose:** Specify exactly what to build
**When:** Before each build session
**Key test:** Can the AI build without clarifying questions?

### 5. CLAUDE.md
**Purpose:** Project context for future AI sessions
**When:** After each build
**Key test:** Could a new AI session pick up where you left off?

## The Workflow

### Starting a New Initiative

1. Write the Vision Document
2. Create the System Architecture Map
3. Create a Capability Map for the first system
4. **Create a Phased Delivery Plan** (if 4+ capabilities)
5. Write a PRD for the first capability (or Phase 1 capabilities)
6. Build
7. Update CLAUDE.md
8. Repeat from step 5

### Adding a New System

1. Update the Architecture Map
2. Create a Capability Map for the new system
3. Proceed with PRDs for each capability

### Maintaining Existing Systems

1. Review the Capability Map
2. Write a PRD for the change
3. Build
4. Update CLAUDE.md

## The Key Principles

### 1. Documents Are Thinking Tools
Documents aren't bureaucracy. They're externalized thinking. When you write something down, you discover what you don't know.

### 2. Leverage Lives at the Top
Changes at the Vision level affect everything. Changes at the Implementation level affect one feature. Invest your attention at the highest-leverage level.

### 3. Translation Is Your Job
Your role isn't to code. Your role is to translate Vision > Architecture > Capability > Specification with enough clarity that Implementation happens without you.

### 4. Ambiguity Is the Enemy
Every ambiguity in your specification is a decision the AI makes for you. Sometimes it decides well. Often it doesn't. Make decisions explicit.

### 5. Systems Compound
Your systems aren't separate projects. They're components of one infrastructure. Build with compounding in mind.

## The Strategic Advantage

Most people using AI to build operate at the Specification and Implementation levels. They write PRDs (if they're good) and build. Then they wonder why their systems don't connect, don't compound, and don't serve the larger purpose.

The Strategic Builder operates at all five levels:
- **Vision** - Knows where they're going
- **Architecture** - Sees the whole board
- **Capability** - Designs for jobs, not features
- **Specification** - Writes with precision
- **Implementation** - Verifies against spec

This is the difference between building tactically and building strategically.

This is the difference between the Opportunity Seeker and the Strategic Entrepreneur -- applied to AI-assisted building.
