# Fladlien Architecture Frameworks

Foundation frameworks for webinar structure and development strategy.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a webinar's overall structure
- Deciding if webinars are the right approach for your offer
- Understanding the development and iteration cycle
- Learning Fladlien's approach to webinar architecture

## Frameworks Included (3)

### Master Systems (Ace/King)
- **A1. Four-Section Architecture** - The fundamental structure (Intro 15% → Content 45% → Transition 5% → Close 35%)

### Supporting Frameworks (Jack/10)
- **A2. Three-Stage Development Cycle** - Shippable (80%) → Polish → Recalibrate
- **A3. Webinar Sweet Spot Matrix** - When webinars work vs. when they don't

## How to Use

1. **Validate Approach** - Use A3 (Webinar Sweet Spot Matrix) to confirm webinars are right for your situation
2. **Apply Structure** - Use A1 (Four-Section Architecture) to plan time allocation across sections
3. **Plan Development** - Use A2 (Three-Stage Development) to understand the build and iteration process
4. **Build Sections** - Move to section-specific element skills

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework list with descriptions.

## The Core Architecture Principle

**Four sections, specific time allocation:**

```
INTRO (15%)     CONTENT (45%)    TRANSITION (5%)    CLOSE (35%)
0-15 min        15-45 min        45-50 min         50-90 min

Authority       Teaching         Recap             Offer
Commitment      Emotion          State             Price
Objections      Steps            Bridge            Bonuses
Hope            Vision                            Guarantee
Mystery                                           Objections
                                                  Scarcity

BUT BUILD IN REVERSE ORDER:
CLOSE → CONTENT → INTRO → TRANSITION
```
