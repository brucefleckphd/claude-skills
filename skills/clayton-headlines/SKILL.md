## HEADLINE GATE CHECK (MANDATORY - RUN ON EVERY HEADLINE)

**This gate check is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Headlines that fail are NOT Clayton headlines.**

### Test 1: A-Brain Targeting

Clayton writes to the LIZARD BRAIN first. Ask: Does this headline trigger primal emotion (fear, anger, greed) or engage the thinking brain (concepts, logic, curiosity)?

**FAIL examples (thinking brain):**
- "How to Turn Courses Into AI Agents" - conceptual
- "The $47,293 Hard Drive" - curious but not emotional
- "What If Everything You Know Is Backwards?" - intellectual

**PASS examples (lizard brain):**
- "THEY LIED TO YOU." - immediate anger
- "SHAMELESS TWO-FACED S.O.B.s!" - rage
- "BETRAYED AGAIN!" - anger/fear
- "FORBIDDEN CURES!" - fear/anger

### Test 2: Emotional Trigger Word Presence

Headline MUST contain at least one word from these categories:

| Category | Trigger Words |
|----------|---------------|
| Betrayal | lied, betrayed, backstabbed, deceived, sold out, double-crossed, hoodwinked, conned, scammed |
| Anger | outrage, scandal, fraud, crooks, shameless, exploited, robbed, swindled, violated |
| Fear | warning, danger, deadly, devastating, crisis, collapse, meltdown, time bomb |
| Greed | fortune, jackpot, windfall, goldmine, bonanza, wealth, profit, cash |

**No trigger words = REWRITE**

### Test 3: The 3-Second Gut Test

Read headline aloud. Physical response check:
- Feel it in your gut? → PASS
- Feel it in your head? → FAIL

### Test 4: Clayton Lineup Test

Could your headline sit alongside these without looking out of place?
- "LIES, LIES, LIES!"
- "SHAMELESS TWO-FACED S.O.B.'s!"
- "BETRAYED AGAIN!"
- "FORBIDDEN CURES!"

If it looks like it's from a different writer → REWRITE

## ANTI-PATTERNS: Headlines That FAIL the Clayton Test

**Learn to recognize what NOT to write:**

❌ "How a 'Guru to the Gurus' Turned $2,000 in Worthless Courses Into an Army of AI Workers That Execute Million-Dollar Strategies While He Sleeps"
- FAILS: Conceptual, no emotional trigger, way too long, engages thinking brain

❌ "The $47,293 Hard Drive: Why Your Most Valuable Business Assets Are Trapped in Courses You'll Never Finish"
- FAILS: Interesting but not emotional, no visceral words, curiosity without anger

❌ "What If Everything You Know About 'Buying Courses' Is Backwards?"
- FAILS: Soft question, no punch, no trigger words, too intellectual

**Rewrites that PASS:**

✅ "THEY LIED TO YOU About Every Course You Ever Bought"
- PASSES: Betrayal trigger, anger, accusation, personal, short

✅ "SHAMELESS Course Gurus Left You With a $47,000 Graveyard"
- PASSES: Anger word, specific number, vivid death image, accusation
