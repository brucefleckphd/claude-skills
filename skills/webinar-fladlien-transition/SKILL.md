# Fladlien Transition Frameworks

Complete framework set for the 5-minute bridge (45-50 min mark)—from teaching to selling with unstoppable momentum.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating the transition section of your webinar
- Bridging from content to close
- Getting into the right psychological state to sell boldly
- Building final momentum before the pitch

**Important:** Build your transition LAST (after close, content, and intro)!

## Frameworks Included (4)

### Core Frameworks (King/Queen)
- **D1. Transition Purpose Reframe** - "Transition serves YOU more than customer"
- **D3. Half-Dozen Yeses** - Six questions leading directly to offer
- **D4. Two Choices Frame** - "Part ways and hope" vs "Take active role"

### Supporting Framework (Jack)
- **D2. 60-in-60 Recap** - Summarize entire content in 60 seconds

## How to Use

**Use all four frameworks in this exact sequence:**

1. **D1. Purpose Reframe** (30 seconds) - Get YOURSELF ready to sell boldly
2. **D2. 60-in-60 Recap** (60-90 seconds) - Summarize content with flair
3. **D3. Half-Dozen Yeses** (2 minutes) - Six questions building to offer
4. **D4. Two Choices Frame** (1-2 minutes) - Present the fork in the road

Total time: 3-5 minutes

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for complete framework descriptions.

## The Transition Purpose

**Core Insight:** "The transition serves YOU more than the customer."

Purpose:
- Put YOURSELF in the right psychological state to sell boldly
- Without it: You apologize for selling, rush through close
- With it: You serve confidently by offering the solution

The transition is for your mental state, not theirs.

## The Four-Step Bridge

```
CONTENT ENDS              TRANSITION ZONE             CLOSE BEGINS
(Teaching)                (The Bridge)                (Selling)

[Teaching    →    D1: Reframe State (You)         →   [Confident
 Complete]        D2: Recap Content (Them)             Selling
                  D3: Get Six Yeses (Momentum)          State]
                  D4: Frame Two Choices (Bridge)
```

## The Sequence Breakdown

### Step 1: D1. Purpose Reframe (30 seconds)

**Internal dialogue shift:**
- From: "I feel bad about selling"
- To: "I serve them by offering the solution"

**What to say:**
- "We've covered a lot..."
- "Before we continue, I want to be clear..."
- "The transition from teaching to what comes next..."

**Key:** This is primarily for YOU, not them.

---

### Step 2: D2. 60-in-60 Recap (60-90 seconds)

**Summarize ENTIRE content in one minute:**
- Speak with energy and flair
- Speak as if they ALREADY possess the knowledge
- List steps/frameworks covered
- Remind them of the journey

**Structure:**
"So far we've covered [Step 1], [Step 2], [Step 3]... You now understand [outcome]..."

**Purpose:** Reinforce learning, build confidence, create momentum

---

### Step 3: D3. Half-Dozen Yeses (2 minutes)

**Six specific questions, all answered "yes":**

Format: "Can I ask you a question? [PAUSE for yes]"

**Questions build progressively:**
1. General agreement about problem
2. General agreement about solution direction
3. Specific agreement about your approach
4. Agreement about their readiness
5. Agreement about taking action
6. **Last question leads DIRECTLY to offer**

Example of question 6: "If I could show you how to get [outcome] with [unique mechanism], would you want to know about it?"

**Purpose:** Build agreeable state, create momentum toward offer

---

### Step 4: D4. Two Choices Frame (1-2 minutes)

**Present the fork in the road:**

**CHOICE A** (Undesirable)
- "Part ways here and hope it works out"
- Passive language
- Uncertain outcome
- Going it alone

**CHOICE B** (Desirable)
- "Take an active role with my help"
- Active language
- Certain process
- Guided support

**Key Framing:**
- Not good vs. bad
- Not my way vs. wrong way
- Just: Passive/uncertain vs. Active/guided

**Purpose:** Position offer as favor, not evil. Make Choice B the obvious path.

## Core Principles

1. **Transition serves YOU** - Get into right state to sell boldly
2. **Use all four** - Don't skip any of these frameworks
3. **Follow the sequence** - D1 → D2 → D3 → D4 in order
4. **Build momentum** - Each step increases forward motion
5. **Bridge, don't jump** - Smooth transition, not jarring shift

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1:** Skipping the transition entirely
- Going directly from teaching to selling feels jarring
- You're not in the right psychological state

**Mistake #2:** Making it too long
- Should be 3-5 minutes maximum
- Don't let it become another teaching section

**Mistake #3:** Only serving them, not you
- D1 (Purpose Reframe) is FOR YOU
- Get your mindset right first

**Mistake #4:** Weak Two Choices Frame
- Don't make Choice A sound appealing
- Make it clearly passive/uncertain vs. active/guided

## Validation Questions

**Before moving to close, check:**
- Am I in a bold selling state? (D1)
- Did I recap the value delivered? (D2)
- Are they in an agreeable state? (D3)
- Is the bridge clear and natural? (D4)
