# Brunson Content Frameworks

Complete framework set for the Perfect Webinar teaching section—the One Thing, Three Secrets structure, belief pattern breaking, and paradigm shift methodology.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating or improving Perfect Webinar content sections
- Structuring teaching that drives sales (not just education)
- Breaking and rebuilding audience belief patterns
- Teaching paradigm shifts instead of step-by-step how-to
- Ensuring your three secrets all reinforce one core thing

**Critical:** Brunson's teaching creates BELIEF, not just knowledge. The paradigm shift IS the teaching.

## Frameworks Included (23)

### Master Systems (Tier 1)
- **The One Thing Principle** - Focus on ONE core belief, not multiple (Perry Belcher)
- **Break and Rebuild Belief Pattern** - Break false beliefs, rebuild with new paradigm
- **Teaching That Sets Up Sale vs Teaching That Doesn't** - Paradigm shifts sell, how-to doesn't

### Core Frameworks (Tier 2)
- **How To Without Template** - "How to [want] without [don't want]"
- **Three Secrets Framework** - Three secrets that all reinforce the one thing
- **Paradigm Shift as Teaching** - Belief shift feels like learning, sets up sale
- **The Secret Number Structure** - Preview all three secrets before diving in
- **The Teaching Paradox** - Person who teaches most doesn't make most money
- **The Speaking-Without-Teaching Paradox** - Educational events vs sales webinars
- **Useful But Incomplete Content Formula** - Builds trust + creates product need
- **The Perfect Webinar Nine-Out-Of-Ten Template** - 9/10 people structure this wrong
- **Multi-Benefit vs One-Thing (Failure Pattern)** - Multiple beliefs kill conversion

### Solid Frameworks (Tier 3)
- **Future Pacing Technique** - "What's your spouse gonna say?"
- **Journey-Based Teaching** - Take them on your discovery journey
- **Hook Callback Technique** - Reference back to initial tease
- **Future Pacing Within Content** - Escalate scenarios after explaining math
- **Breaking vs Justifying False Beliefs** - Validate first, then break
- **Old Model vs New Model Comparison** - Show contrast to highlight superiority
- **Number of Clicks Reframe** - High-ticket vs low-ticket traffic math
- **The Seven Things Failure** - Teaching multiple tactics creates overwhelm
- **Secret Reveal Trial Close Sequence** - Multiple trial closes after each secret

### Supporting Frameworks (Tier 4)
- **Commission-Based Salespeople Framing** - "Only pay when they make you money"
- **The $36,000 Day Story** - Specific proof story within teaching

## How to Use

1. **Define Your One Thing** - Use "How To Without Template" to crystallize core belief
2. **Structure Three Secrets** - Each secret breaks different false belief, rebuilds to support one thing
3. **Break and Rebuild** - Don't just teach new way—break old belief, then rebuild
4. **Journey-Based Teaching** - Take them through YOUR discovery journey
5. **Future Pace Throughout** - Make them FEEL the outcome emotionally
6. **Keep It Incomplete** - Useful but incomplete—product is logical next step
7. **Validate Structure** - Do all three secrets reinforce one thing, or teach three different things?

## Quick Reference

See `references/index.md` for categorized list with one-line descriptions.

## The One Thing Principle (Foundation)

**The Perry Belcher Discovery:**

Russell learned from Perry Belcher: Sales letters that tried to get people to believe TWO OR MORE things always flopped. Sales letters that got people to believe ONE THING were successful.

**The Most Common Mistake:**

9 out of 10 people structure their webinar wrong. They create:
- Thing 1 (first thing they're excited to teach)
- Thing 2 (next cool thing)
- Thing 3 (another great tactic)

Result: Awesome teacher, massive value, no sales.

**The Correct Structure:**

- THE ONE THING (the core belief they must adopt)
- Secret 1 (reinforces the one thing from angle 1)
- Secret 2 (reinforces the one thing from angle 2)
- Secret 3 (reinforces the one thing from angle 3)

**Quality Check:** After creating your content, ask: "Do my three secrets teach three different topics, or do they all reinforce the same core belief from different angles?"

## The Three Secrets Framework

**Structure:**

1. **Preview All Three** - Before diving in, list all three secrets upfront
2. **Teach Each Fully** - One at a time, complete teaching for each
3. **Circle Back** - All three must strengthen the one thing

**Russell's High-Ticket Webinar Example:**

- **One Thing:** "How to instantly add high ticket sales to your sales funnel without personally talking on the phone to anyone ever"
- **Secret 1:** You don't need to sell $37 products (break low-ticket belief)
- **Secret 2:** You only need 2 commission-based salespeople (break scale fear)
- **Secret 3:** The math makes it inevitable (break traffic objection)

All three secrets reinforce the SAME core belief: high-ticket without phone calls is possible and superior.

## Break and Rebuild Belief Pattern

**The Core Teaching Method:**

For each secret/teaching point:

1. **Identify the false belief** - What do they currently believe that's wrong?
2. **Break that pattern** - Show why it's limiting/wrong
3. **Rebuild with new pattern** - Install the belief you want them to hold
4. **Take them on the journey** - Show how YOU discovered this shift

**Example: Breaking the Phone Fear**

- **False Belief:** "I have to personally close high-ticket sales on the phone"
- **Break:** "Here's three reasons why people like me should NEVER pick up the phone: too busy, scared to death, bad positioning"
- **Rebuild:** "You only need 2 commission-based salespeople"
- **Journey:** "I used to have 60 salespeople (nightmare), then discovered this new model"

**Critical Insight:** Your secrets should be "backwards from what most people are thinking or what most people believe."

## Paradigm Shift IS Teaching

**The Brunson Philosophy:**

You don't need to give step-by-step how-to instructions to teach effectively. Shifting someone's paradigm and belief system FEELS like learning and is more powerful than procedural steps.

**The Teaching Paradox:**

The person who teaches the most does NOT make the most money. Too much information overwhelms attendees, making them feel they have enough to work on already, eliminating buying motivation.

**Educational Event vs Sales Webinar:**

- **Educational Event** (like Boise): 3 days of teaching everything, no selling, pure fulfillment
- **Sales Webinar**: Useful but incomplete content structured to make product purchase the logical next step

These are fundamentally different tools. Don't confuse them.

**The Sweet Spot:**

Content must be:
- **Useful** (builds trust, demonstrates expertise)
- **Incomplete** (creates gap that product fills)

If only useful: no sales (they have enough to work on)
If only incomplete: no trust (seems like tease)
Combined: they trust you AND need product to complete the system

## Future Pacing Technique

**The Method:**

While teaching, regularly push the audience into the future with vivid, specific questions:

- "In a month from now when you're doing that, what's it gonna be like?"
- "What's your spouse gonna say?"
- "What are your kids gonna think when all of a sudden their dad's at home and they're making twice as much money?"

**After Explaining Math:**

After showing the logic/numbers, immediately future pace with escalation:

- "Imagine if you sent 100 clicks a day"
- "Imagine if you sent 200 clicks a day"
- "Imagine if you sent 300 clicks a day"
- "Boom, boom, boom"

This transforms intellectual understanding into emotional reality.

## Journey-Based Teaching

**Don't Just Tell Them the New Way:**

Take them on the journey YOU went through to discover it.

**The Five Elements:**

1. **What you used to believe/do** - Show you had the same false belief
2. **What didn't work** - The pain/failure of the old model
3. **The aha moment** - The experiment or realization
4. **The new way** - The paradigm you discovered
5. **Results from new way** - Proof it works

**Russell's Example:**

"I had the same pattern in my head. That's why I had 60 salespeople working for me. So I'm taking them on the journey I went through to break that, I had to go through to break my own pattern and how I rebuilt it."

## Breaking vs Justifying False Beliefs

**The Counterintuitive Approach:**

Don't just address objections—JUSTIFY them first, then break them.

**Russell's Phone Fear Example:**

1. **Justify:** "Here's three reasons why people like me should never pick up the phone:"
   - I'm way too busy
   - I'm scared to death
   - It's bad positioning

2. **Audience thinks:** "Yeah, I'm too busy too. Yeah, I'm scared. Oh, bad positioning, sweet, yeah, I don't want to talk to them anyway."

3. **Then break:** Show the solution that eliminates the need for phones entirely

**Quality Standard:** Can you articulate their limiting belief better than they can? That's the bar.

## Old Model vs New Model Comparison

**The Power of Contrast:**

Show the old model (how you used to do it or how most people do it), demonstrate why it doesn't work or is inefficient, then contrast with the new model.

**Russell's Salespeople Example:**

- **Old Model:** 60 salespeople (nightmare)
- **New Model:** 2 commission-based salespeople (simple, risk-free)

Visual comparison makes the superiority of the new model obvious.

**Quality Check:** Make the old model recognizable as what they're currently doing. Make the new model clearly superior and simpler.

## The Content Build Sequence

```
1. Define Your One Thing (How To Without Template)
   ↓
2. Identify Three Secrets (each breaks different false belief)
   ↓
3. Validate All Three Support One Thing (not three separate topics)
   ↓
4. For Each Secret:
   - Identify false belief
   - Break that pattern (justify first, then break)
   - Rebuild with new pattern
   - Show old model vs new model
   - Tell your journey story
   - Future pace the outcome
   - Trial close
   ↓
5. Keep Content Useful But Incomplete
   ↓
6. Validate: 9-Out-Of-Ten Check
```

## Trial Closes After Each Secret

**After revealing a big secret, drop multiple trial closes:**

- "Wouldn't that be great if you could [desired outcome]?"
- "Isn't that awesome?"
- "Are you scared of [pain point] too? Yeah, me too."
- "Just imagine how it would change your life."

This empathizes with pain point and future-paces the solution before transitioning to next secret.

## High-Ticket Math Reframe

**Breaking the Traffic Belief:**

Contrast low-ticket vs high-ticket traffic needs with specific math:

**Low-Ticket ($37 product):**
- To make $5,000/month
- Need 135 sales
- At 3% conversion = 4,500 clicks
- That's really, really hard

**High-Ticket ($5,000 product):**
- To make $1,000/day
- Need 1 sale
- 1 in 10 apply, 1 in 10 buy
- Only need 100 clicks

The math makes high-ticket obviously superior and more achievable.

## Common Failure Patterns

### The Multi-Benefit Failure
Presenters who love their product try to sell it on every facet and benefit, requiring the audience to believe 4-5 different things. Result: Conversion drops from 5-6% to 1-2%.

### The Seven Things Failure
Getting on stage and showing "my seven best things about making money." Audience gets massive value, learns seven things, has seven things to go do. Result: They never buy (too overwhelmed).

### The Thing 1, Thing 2, Thing 3 Failure
Creating webinar as: First exciting thing + Next cool thing + Another great tactic. Result: Awesome teacher, people love you, no sales.

## Validation Questions

**Before finalizing content, ask:**

- Have I identified my ONE THING clearly? (How To Without Template)
- Do my three secrets all reinforce the one thing, or do they teach three different topics?
- For each secret: Am I breaking a false belief and rebuilding it?
- Am I taking them on my discovery journey?
- Am I future pacing the emotional outcome?
- Is my content useful but incomplete?
- Would buying my product be the logical next step?
- Am I teaching paradigm shifts (beliefs) or step-by-step how-to?

**The 9-Out-Of-10 Warning:** If your answer to "Do my three secrets reinforce one thing?" is no, you're in the 9-out-of-10 failure pattern. Restructure before launch.
